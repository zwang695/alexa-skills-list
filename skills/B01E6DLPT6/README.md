To use the Unicorn Trivia skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, launch Unicorn Trivia*

* *Repeat*

* *Help*

This skill quizzes you on your knowledge of unicorns, the venture-backed billion dollar companies (not the one-horned fairy tale horses). To start, Alexa will read you the instructions for the game. Then, you will answer five questions from an ever-growing databank of unicorn questions. After Alexa reads the four possible answers, simply indicate to Alexa which answer you think is correct ("one", "two", "three", or "four"). See if you can answer all five questions correctly in a row, and play again to discover new questions and learn more about some of today's most cutting-edge companies.
