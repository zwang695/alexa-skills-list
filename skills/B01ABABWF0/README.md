To use the UncleShakespeare skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, Tell Uncle Shakespeare to insult me!*

* *Alexa, Ask Uncle Shakespeare for an insult.*

* *Alexa, Ask Uncle Shakespeare to tell me something*

An insult crafted from Shakespeare's lexicon is almost a compliment!

The 'Ask Uncle Shakespeare' skill is an amusing way to use Alexa to generate insults in the lofty language of The Bard! Words are chosen at random from a bank of Shakespeare's adjectives and nouns, delivered in sentence form.

Inspired by the many 'Shakespeare Insult' web pages and the (original?) Shakespeare insult worksheet created long ago by Jerry Maquire, English Teacher at Center Grove High School in Greenwood, Indiana.

Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
Thanks for trying the skill.
