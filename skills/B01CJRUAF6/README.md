Go to our website https://www.baby-stats.com if you need help, or have specific questions and would like to contact us. 

Scroll down here to see the Usage section of this skill so you know all the different ways to interact with us.

You can track your baby's stats on multiple devices simply by entering an ID generated for you by the application. NO LOGIN required. We won't ask you for your email, babies name, date of birth, due date or anything.

USAGE:
Using the Alexa skill you have the following options:

Set Timzone: Make sure to set your timezone so the skill can report back the correct times based on your timezone.
Alexa, ask baby stats to set timezone {pacific, central, eastern, mountain, atlantic, hawaiian, alaska, or united kingdom}

Add Stat: Tracks a stat at the current time.
Alexa, ask baby stats to add {stool, poop}
Alexa, tell baby stats {she,he} {pooped, peed}
Alexa, ask baby stats to add {wet, pee}
Alexa, ask baby stats to add {feeding, meal, bottle}
Alexa, ask baby stats to add weight {X} pounds and {Y} ounces {NOTE: Currently X and Y can only be whole numbers, .5, 1.5, 2.5 etc... will not work correctly}

For feedings you can also track the ounces.
Alexa, ask baby stats to add {feeding, meal, bottle} 4 point 5 ounces.
NOTE:
You have to say "X ounces", or "X point Y ounces". She will not understand if you say "four and a half ounces" or something similar to that. Currently, Y can only be in increments of .25 (.25, .5, .75) so you'll need to round off to the nearest quarter ounce when you speak to her.

Remove Stat: Removes the last stat that was tracked.
Alexa, ask baby stats to undo
Alexa, ask baby stats to remove {stool, wet, feeding, weight, or note}

Add Stat: Tracks a stat at a specific time.
Alexa, ask baby stats to add {stool, poop} at 4 pm
Alexa, ask baby stats to add {wet, pee} at 3:40 in the morning
Alexa, ask baby stats to add {feeding, meal, bottle} at noon
Alexa, ask baby stats to add {feeding, meal, bottle} 4.5 ounces at noon

Alexa, ask baby stats to add poop and pee
Alexa, ask baby stats to add {stool, wet or feeding} and {stool, wet or feeding} 
Alexa, ask baby stats to add {stool, wet or feeding} and {stool, wet or feeding} at 4 pm
Alexa, ask baby stats to add {feeding} 4.5 ounces and {stool, wet} at 4 pm
Alexa, ask baby stats to add {stool, wet} and {feeding} 4.5 ounces at 4 pm

Get Stats: Tells you the last time that a stat has occurred.
Alexa, ask baby stats when was the last stat
Alexa, ask baby stats when was the last {poop, pee, note, weight ...}
Alexa, ask baby stats what time was the last feeding
Alexa, ask baby stats to get stats for today

Data Sharing: Once you have been tracking your stats you can use our website or mobile applications to view your stats and get summaries of the counts.
If you want to view everything that you've tracked:
1. Alexa, ask baby stats to get id. This will tell you your unique ID that is used to store the data.
2. Navigate to http://www.baby-stats.com/viewer.html in any browser and enter the ID and click "Load", or enter the ID in one of our mobile applications and click save.

Add Notes: Allows for a free form entry as a note. Alexa doesn't work very well with free form speech recognition, so if you are having trouble adding a stat you'd like to track let us know.
Alexa, ask baby stats to add note pumped 4 ounces
Alexa, ask baby stats to add note pumped 2.25 ounces
Alexa, ask baby stats to add note slept 8 hours (don't we all hope!)
Alexa, ask baby stats to add note brown poop
