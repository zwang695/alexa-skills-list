To use the Capital One skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, Open Capital One*

* *Alexa, ask Capital One what's my account balance?*

* *Alexa, ask Capital One to make a credit card payment.*

Ask Capital One about your credit card, checking, savings, auto and home loan accounts. Then try out our new feature, "How much did I spend?" to get quick answers on how much and where you are spending. 

Once you’ve enabled the skill, say “Alexa ask Capital One…”

For your credit card:
· “How much did I spend at Target last month?” 
· “How much did I spend at Starbucks last weekend?”
· “What’s my current credit card balance?”
· “When is my credit card bill due?”
· “To pay my credit card bill.”

For your bank accounts:
· “What’s my checking account balance?”
· “What are my recent transactions?”

For your auto loan:
· “What’s my car loan principal balance?” 
· “What's my payoff quote?”
· “When is my car loan due?”
· “To pay my car loan bill.” 

For your home loan:
· “What's the principal balance on my mortgage?”
· “When is my next mortgage payment due?”
· “How much is my next mortgage payment?”
