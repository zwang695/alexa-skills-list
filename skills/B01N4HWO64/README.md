To use the Mister Twist skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, Tell Mister Twist to Spin the Wheel*

* *Tell Mister Twist to Spin*

* *Tell Mister Twist to Spin the wheel Twice*

Mister Twist solves the classic problem: everyone wants to play, but no one wants to spin! All you need to do is ask Mister Twist to Spin the wheel to get a move. Want to double the challenge? Ask Mister Twist to spin twice for two moves at once! Mister Twist is an unofficial Twister enhancer and is sponsored nor endorsed by the game Twister nor Mister Twister.
