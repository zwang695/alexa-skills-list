To use the PokEvolve for Pokemon GO skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, talk to poke evolve.*

* *Alexa, ask poke evolve about Magikarp.*

* *Alexa, ask poke evolve to repeat that.*

PokEvolve allows you to look up the evolution info for various Pokémon in Pokémon GO. Just ask about a Pokémon form, and it will tell you about the evolution chain and how many candies are required to evolve to the next form.

For example, say "Alexa, ask poke evolve about Magikarp", and it will tell you that 400 candies are required to evolve Magikarp into Gyarados.

You can also say "Ask poke evolve about the skill itself", or, if you miss a response, you can say "Ask poke evolve to repeat that".
