To use the Pentair ScreenLogic skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open Pentair*

* *Alexa, ask Pentair what my pool temperature is*

* *Alexa, ask Pentair to turn on my Spa*

Amazon Alexa and the ScreenLogic interface for Pentair's IntelliTouch and EasyTouch pool/spa control systems work together to help you set the perfect pool or spa temperature without having to lift a finger.

You can also turn your various circuits (pool, spa, waterfall, lights, etc) on or off with your voice.

There's no need to hunt for your wireless remote or iOS/Android device - just talk to Alexa on your Amazon Echo, Fire TV, Echo Dot or Tap.

After connecting Alexa to your Pentair IntelliTouch or EasyTouch control system (with ScreenLogic) in a few simple steps, just say commands like "Alexa, ask Pentair to turn on my Waterfall.", or "Alexa, ask Pentair what my pool temperature is.", or "Alexa, ask Pentair what my pool status is"

Here are examples of how you can use the Skill:

Alexa, tell/ask Pentair to turn on <AUX or Feature Circuit name â€“ e.g. AUX1 or Spa Jets, Waterfall, etc.>

Alexa, tell/ask Pentair to turn on the Pool

Alexa, tell/ask Pentair to turn on the Spa

Alexa, ask Pentair what the Pool temperature is

Alexa, ask Pentair what the Spa temperature is

Alexa, ask Pentair what the pH level is

Alexa, ask Pentair what the ORP level is

Alexa, ask Pentair what my pool status is

The above request, depending on your installed equipment, will return for those with the IntelliChem pH/ORP system only (as checked in the ScreenLogic configuration):
Your <alias> pool is currently 87 degrees, pH is 7.35 and ORP is 725. The pool, chlorinator, etc., circuits are currently running.

For those with IntelliChem and IntelliChlor (as checked in the ScreenLogic configuration):
Your <alias> pool is currently 87 degrees, pH is 7.35 and ORP is 725. Your salt level is 3200 ppm. The pool, chlorinator, etc., circuits are currently running.

For those with only IntelliChlor (as checked in the ScreenLogic configuration):
Your <alias> pool is currently 87 degrees and your salt level is 3200 ppm. The pool, chlorinator, etc, etc. circuits are currently running.

Amazon would like us to inform you that this skill may not be suitable for all ages.
