To use the Read the Doctrine and Covenants This Year skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open Doctrine Covenants*

* *Alexa, ask Doctrine Covenants for today's verses*

* *Alexa, ask Doctrine Covenants to get today's reading*

This skill lets Alexa read a daily scheduled passage from the Doctrine and Covenants.

We start on January 1st every year and end on December 31st, so join in with us!

Unfortunately Amazon has restricted the skill by removing the word "and", so when speaking with Alexa you'll have to say "Doctrine Covenants" instead of "Doctrine and Covenants". Sorry!

Ask Alexa every day to hear that day's reading. If you miss a day, no problem! Just ask Alexa to read the missed reading by saying:
Alexa, get the reading for yesterday from the Doctrine Covenants
-or-
Alexa, ask the Doctrine Covenants to get the reading from December 1st, 2016.

Other ways to phrase your interaction:

-- Listen to today's verses --
Alexa, ask the Doctrine Covenants to read today's scriptures.
Alexa, ask Doctrine Covenants to read.
Alexa, read from the Doctrine Covenants.
Alexa, ask the Doctrine Covenants for todayâ€™s reading.

-- Read the scriptures for another date --
Alexa, ask the Doctrine Covenants to read me the scriptures for tomorrow.
Alexa, get the reading for yesterday from the Doctrine Covenants.
Alexa, ask the Doctrine Covenants to read for December 29th.
