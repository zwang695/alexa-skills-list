Tracker's Election Odds is the premier way to get the inside scoop on who is likely to win the U.S  presidency! Studies have found prediction markets to be better at predicting election outcomes than polls, so Tracker uses data from the political betting market Betfair.com to bring you the most accurate prediction possible for the outcome of the upcoming election. To learn more, including why prediction markets are more accurate than polls, see electionbettingodds.com/about.html

Ask Tracker for a summary to hear an overview of the current predictions for who is likely to win the presidency.

You can also ask Tracker about the skill itself, or, if you miss a response, ask Tracker to repeat it.
