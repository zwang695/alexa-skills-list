To use the Honeywell Total Connect Comfort International skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, set Living Room to 20 degrees*

* *Alexa, turn on Hot Water*

* *Alexa, turn on Economy Mode*

With the Honeywell skill and Alexa, you can now interact with your Honeywell evohome and Single Zone Thermostats with your voice.  

To get started, select the ‘Enable Skill’ button in the Alexa App to link your Honeywell account and discover your thermostat(s). Find more information about connecting Smart Home devices at http://amzn.to/291lR7u

When using the skill, you need to specify by name which thermostat/sensor to use. There are two ways to define this/these names:
- Use the name(s) you set up already – these are shown and can be changed in the Total Connect Comfort app, or
- Create an Alexa group, like “Bedroom” or “Downstairs”, and add the thermostat and/or one or more sensors to the group. More information at http://amzn.to/2965dCE

Once you know the name or group of your thermostat, you can say the following: “Alexa, lower Bedroom by 3 degrees”, or “Alexa, set ‘my home’ temperature to 21 degrees”.
A list of example commands includes:
- “Alexa, set [group/zone or thermostat name] to X degrees”
- “Alexa, raise [group/zone or thermostat name] by X degrees”
- “Alexa, lower [group/zone or thermostat name] by X degrees”
- “Alexa, turn on hot water”
- “Alexa, turn on economy mode”

User experience notes:
- Alexa will allow you to set your temperature to the same limits as our mobile app. In some cases, Connected Round will allow you to only go to 30C via the app but 35C on the device.
- Changing the temperature remotely on a Single Zone Thermostat will not show on the display unless you move the wheel in either direction to see the current temperature.
