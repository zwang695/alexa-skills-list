To use the Scryb skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, tell Scryb that I'm home*

* *Alexa, open Scryb*

* *Alexa, tell Scryb that the phone number is 613-555-1215*

Scryb makes it easy for anyone to send a SMS text message hands-free from home, or when you don't have access to a smartphone.

To start using the Scryb skill, say:
"Alexa, open Scryb."  (pronounce it like the word ‘scribe’)
Alexa will then ask you for the phone number of the text recipient.

Then tell Alexa the 10 digit phone number - example: "123-555-1212"

We suggest that you say:
"Alexa, tell Scryb that I'm home." or, "Alexa, tell Scryb that I am going to the gym now."
We have found by using "that" before the text message it can reduce errors.

If you are asking a question of the recipient, try:
"Alexa, ask Scryb when are you coming home?"
Minor note, sent questions will not end in a question mark.

To verify what the configured number is, you can say:
"Alexa, ask Scryb what the number is"

Also, please remember that: 
- It is not possible to receive replies to the text messages through Alexa
- Only one destination phone number is supported
- Only 10 digit North America phone numbers can be used
- All messages are sent from (613) 909-8893
