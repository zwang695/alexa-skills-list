To use the Mom's Cooking skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Mom's Cooking for cookies.*

* *Alexa, ask Mom's Cooking the recipe for chili.*

* *Alexa, ask Mom's Cooking how to make beef stroganoff.*

My mom wrote a cookbook of recipes from my youth, and gave each of us kids a copy when we went off to college. This skill looks up the recipes by keyword, and presents them as a card in the Alexa companion app. Reproduced with permission.
