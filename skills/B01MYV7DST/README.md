To use the FreeDays skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask bank holidays for the next free day in Poland*

* *when is the next bank holiday in Czechia*

* *give me the next free day in Estonia*

The skill allows you to find out the next free day (banking holiday) in a specific Country. You will get both the official name of the next free day  and in how many days you need to wait for it.
From now on you will never be surprised and can start organising your day-off in advance. 
46 countries (http://holidays.kayaposoft.com/) supported and support for regions will be added soon.
