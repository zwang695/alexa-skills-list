* *Alexa, open Marc's Trivia*

* *dunno*

* *the answer is one*

Marc's Trivia embodies the intelligence of Alexa's supreme voice recognition with the complex coding to sort through right and wrong answers. The user gets started by opening the game and being asked questions in which he or she has to answer correctly. It's designed in the code that the first answer is always correct logically, but when spoken aloud by Alexa, she randomizes them each time.
