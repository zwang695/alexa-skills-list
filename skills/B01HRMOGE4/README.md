To use the CloudStatus skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask CloudStatus about all regions*

* *Tell me more about Northern Virginia*

* *What's up in ap-south-1?*

The CloudStatus Alexa Skill provides an interface to AWS service status information.

Let CloudStatus know what region you want to check and Alexa will respond with a list of services that are experiencing trouble and what kind of issues they are having. CloudStatus will also list services that have recently-resolved issues.

When issues occur, please access the AWS status page directly for details: http://status.aws.amazon.com/

Note: If AWS Lambda in us-east-1 is experiencing a disruption, the CloudStatus skill itself may not be responsive.
