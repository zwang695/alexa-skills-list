To use the Techno Babble skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Techno Babble what is a modem.*

* *Tell me what DEF CON is.*

* *Give me a random word.*

Techno Babble is a skill for the computer illiterate and tech gurus alike. Heard someone from IT talking about "TCP/IP" and you don't know what that means? Or perhaps you forgot what "Kerberos" is while studying for your test on authentication protocols. With Techno Babble, you can search for the definition of over a thousand terms. The terms range anywhere from "mouse" to "IPX/SPX", there is useful information for people of all computer-savviness. By using this skill, you are guaranteed to start speaking like an IT ninja, or your money back (well, as with all my projects, they are free for life anyway).
