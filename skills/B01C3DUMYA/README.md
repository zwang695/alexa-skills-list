To use the Roddenberry's Trek Quotes skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, talk to Roddenberry.*

* *Alexa, ask Roddenberry for a quote from Data.*

* *Alexa, ask Roddenberry for a random quote.*

Roddenberry's Trek Quotes is a fun, fast, and fabulous way to reminisce about your favorite Trek moments, get to know the senior TNG crew members better, or just entertain Trekkie guests. Use this skill for pure entertainment value, or use the random quote feature to turn it into a drinking game.

Ask Roddenberry for a quote to hear one of a curated selection of the best crew quotes.

Examples of things you can do are: ask Roddenberry to give you a quote from any senior TNG crew member, ask him to surprise you, or ask him to repeat the previous quote.

Unlike Alexa experiences that use simplistic random algorithms, annoyingly repeating the same responses over and over while there's still more to hear, Roddenberry won't repeat any quotes until you've heard them all. We GUARANTEE he'll play you only unique quotes until you've listened to ALL of them. We've also worked hard to make sure Alexa reads the quotes as naturally, and as close to way the original crew member said them, as possible.

At Majel Tech, we pride ourselves on our best-in-class language recognition. We've spent a lot of time at thinking up anything you might naturally say in requesting Roddenberry's functionality. Go ahead, try it! We think you'll be pleased.

Note: that being said, we're not perfect! If Alexa starts her response with "A quote from <crew member>", that means she believes you requested a quote from a random crew member. If you had actually requested a quote from someone in particular, she misheard you (you can always look at the card in the Alexa app to see for sure which crew member the quote is from). Please try again, and if it doesn't work, let us know! We want to continually improve our language recognition, and your feedback helps us do that! You can use the "Send Feedback" link at the bottom of this screen to do so. Thanks!
