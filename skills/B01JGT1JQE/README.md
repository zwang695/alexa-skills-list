To use the Computer History Facts skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask computer history for a fact*

* *Alexa, start computer history*

* *Alexa, tell computer history to give me another fact*

The Computer History Museum in Mountain View California is a wonderful place to explore technology from from the 2000 year old calculator to today's self driving cars, and everything in between. Its magnificent website, www.computerhistory.org, lets you explore whenever you want. The museum's main exhibition, Revolution (http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/topics) is the source for this Alexa skill. In addition to voicing a fact each time it is invoked, it displays a Home Card, in the Alexa companion app, which contains a link to the associated page to learn more. You can also explore by a timeline (http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/timeline) instead of by topic. There are many other online exhibits you can explore at http://www.computerhistory.org/exhibits/.
