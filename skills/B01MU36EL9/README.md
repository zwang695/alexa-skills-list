To use the Keyboard Geek skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open Keyboard Geek.*

The purpose is to give facts about keyboards, something that people may not commonly know. These facts have been hand-picked from years of research from myself, as well as first-hand experience building and testing keyboards.
