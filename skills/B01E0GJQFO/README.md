To use the Who's On First? Baseball Skit skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Baseball Skit for instructions*

* *Alexa, ask Baseball Skit who's on first?*

* *whats my line?*

Entertain your friends by participating in the classic "Whos On First?" comedy dialog. 
Alexa will play the part of Bud Abbott while you say the Lou Costello lines.
At any point you can ask Alexa for your next lines, or you can open the Alexa app and read the lines displayed in the app.
If you have two Alexa devices, like an Echo and a Dot, then you can have them perform the skit together while you and your friends roll on the floor laughing.
