To use the PB Helper skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask PB Helper when are tomorrow's classes?*

* *Alexa, ask PB Helper when is the next class?*

* *Alexa, ask PB Helper who is teaching today at noon?*

If you are a fan of barre or have ever been to a Pure Barre class, you know all too well what a great workout it is and how addictive it can be.  You'll find yourself at home or at work, wondering when the next class is.  It's easy to visit the website and see the schedule, but it's even easier using PB Helper.  

Simply enable the skill and say "Alexa, ask PB Helper..."

To find classes:
"When are today's classes?"
"What are the class times for Saturday?"
"What classes are there for October 30th?"

To find the next class:
"When's the next class?"

And if you already have a class scheduled, you can find out who the instructor is:
"Who is instructing today at noon?"

Note:  Currently this skill is restricted to the Pure Barre location in San Antonio.
