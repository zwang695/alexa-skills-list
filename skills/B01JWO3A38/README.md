To use the Arithlistic skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open Quiz Mathematics*

* *Alexa, launch Quiz Mathematics*

* *Alexa, start Quiz Mathematics*

An incredibly hard maths game involving quiz related lists.

Can be played solo or multiplayer. Just tell Alexa how many people are playing and what their names are. Each player will then be asked a series of arithmetic questions in turn increasing in difficulty for each player when two questions are answered correctly.

Each question will take the form of two or more quiz questions that are related to a number with one or more mathematical operations. For example; what is talc on the Mohs scale minus the atomic number of Lithium?

A player has two options for each question; pass or "the answer is [a number]".

Points will be awarded for accuracy and speed with additional random points for variety. For multiplayer games the winner will be the one with the highest number of points at the end of two minutes.
