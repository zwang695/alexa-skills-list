To use the rainy day fun skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Rainy Day Fun what can I do today?*

* *what are the ingredients for rock candy?*

* *what is kinetic sand?*

This is a list of some fun indoor activities you can do at home on a day when it's not so nice to go outside. You can power lightbulbs with potatoes, grow your own crystals, make waterproof sand or your own playdoh. You can ask what to do today and it will return the full list of possible recipes. Once you know what recipe you want to make, you can ask for the ingredients list, a description of what you want to make, or the recipe on how to make it.
