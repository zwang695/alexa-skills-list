Music Man leverages the SongKick API to allow you to ask two types of questions - (1) where your favorite artist or band is playing next, or (2) what shows are coming to your favorite venue.  See examples below on how to phrase your question.  With thousands of artists and venues, each with multiple words, try some of the different examples below if you don't get an expected reply.

You can try to spell out some short names, e.g.:
