With the 'Almond for Smart Home' skill and Alexa, you can now interact with your lights, switches, dimmers, and thermostats by voice.

To get started, select the ‘Enable Skill’ button in the Alexa App to link your Almond account and discover your device(s). Find more information about connecting Smart Home devices at http://amzn.to/291lR7u
When using the skill, you need to specify by name which device or sensor to use. There are two ways to define this/these names:
• Use the name(s) you set up already – these are shown in the Almond app and can be changed, or
• Create an Alexa group, like Bedroom or Downstairs, and add the device(s) or sensor(s) to the group. More information at http://amzn.to/2965dCE

Once you know the name or group of your device(s), you can say the following: 
* If you have switches or non-dimmable lights, you can turn them on/off, for example: “Alexa, turn on my Bedroom lights”.
* If you have dimmable lights, you can change the brightness, for example: “Alexa, brighten Downstairs to 60 percent", or "Alexa, dim the Living Room lights".
* If you have thermostats, you can change the temperature, for example: “Alexa, lower Bedroom by 3 degrees”, or “Alexa, set Downstairs temperature to 72”.

For more advanced router features such as controlling guest network, blocking devices, and activating scenes and modes, go to the Skills section in the Alexa App, search for the ‘Almond’ skill and enable it. Once enabled, say “Alexa, ask Almond for help” for more information
