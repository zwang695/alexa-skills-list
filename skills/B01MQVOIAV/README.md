To use the My Bible Study skill, try saying...

* *Alexa Open My Bible Study*

* *Alexa, ask My Bible Study to read me a memory verse*

* *Alexa, tell My Bible Study I want a verse*

This skill is designed to help members of a home Bible study based in Hawthorne, CA memorize important Bible verses that have been selected from our discussions.

As our study continues, the list of Bible verses will grow and expand. (Currently, we have only studied through the first eight chapters of the Gospel of John.)

For initial publication, this skill will simply choose a random verse from our list and read it out loud. As the list of verses grows, we plan to add the ability to request verses by book, date, and sequence.
