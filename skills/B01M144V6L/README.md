To use the Fun Hal skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, launch Fun Hal*

* *Alexa, ask Fun Hal to sing*

* *Alexa, tell Fun Hal to open the pod bay doors*

Remember HAL 9000 from 2001 A Space Odyssey? Well meet Fun Hal, a similar model. Like HAL 9000, Fun Hal will respond to certain requests, such as to self destruct, sing, or even open the pod bay doors.

This is a work in progress, and I plan to add more things you can ask her, as well as some basic logic.
