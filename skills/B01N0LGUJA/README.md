To use the Baseball Reference skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who led the league in doubles.*

* *Who is third in the league in batting average?*

* *Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who lead the National League in home runs in nineteen fifty three*

Welcome to the Baseball Reference Alexa application. This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - "Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three"

Alexa Responds - "Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983."

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - "Who was next?"
Alexa Responds -  "Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983."

- Previous -
User Requests - "Who was previous?"
Alexa Responds -  "Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 ."

- Rank -
User Requests - "Who was sixth?"
Alexa Responds -  "Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983."

- Top -
User Requests - "Who was top three?"
Alexa Responds -  "Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983."
