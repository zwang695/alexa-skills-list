Your Flux WiFi lights now connect to your Amazon Echo family of devices through the Alexa connected home. After a few easy setup steps, you can control your lights with Alexa. All you have to do is say “Alexa, turn on the kitchen lights”, and Alexa and Flux will make it happen.
 
Once you know the name or group of your lights, you can say the following:
“Alexa, turn on the Bedroom light”,
“Alexa, turn off the Bedroom light",
“Alexa, set the kitchen light  to 10 percent”,
“Alexa, dim the living room light by 60 percent”,
“Alexa, set the living room light to 50 percent”,


HOW TO GET CONNECTED
