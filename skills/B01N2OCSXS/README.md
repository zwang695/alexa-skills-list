To use the Party Time skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Party Time is today a holiday*

* *What was the last holiday*

* *What is the next holiday*

Party Time can tell you if a given date is a Holiday, what holiday is coming up next, or what the last holiday was. The current version only supports US holidays, but the underlying API supports many countries - Support for those is coming soon.
