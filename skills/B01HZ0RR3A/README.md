To use the Funny News skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Funny News for the headlines*

* *Alexa, ask Funny News for the report*

* *Alexa, tell Funny News to read me the headlines*

Sometimes the news is too serious... with Funny News, you can get the same information via comical headlines.

For example, instead of hearing news about a robber caught by police, you may hear something like this:

"Rules of a successful robbery: 1) choose your victim carefully; 2) have an escape route planned; 3) don't shoot yourself in the groin; 4) see Rule 3"


*Disclaimer* - Funny News pulls headlines from Fark.com and may therefore contain some mildly inappropriate content not suitable for all ages.
