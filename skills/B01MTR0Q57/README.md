To use the buzz skill, try saying...

* *Alexa open buzz game*

* *Alexa ask buzz game to start a new game on hard*

* *Alexa ask buzz game for help*

See how strong your math really is! In Buzz, you and Alexa will alternate counting up from 1. When you start a game, you’ll be given at least one “buzz” number. If your next number is divisible by that buzz number, you should say “buzz” instead. For example, if 3 is a “buzz” number and your next number is 6, you should say “buzz” instead. But, you may have to juggle several “buzz” numbers! For example, if 3 and 6 are both “buzz” numbers and your next number is 12, you should say “buzz buzz” since 12 is divisible by both. 

To begin, say “new game” and choose your difficulty level. The difficulty affects how many buzz numbers you’ll get and how much to count up by each turn. See if you can work your way up from easy to impossible mode. How far can you get without making a mistake?
