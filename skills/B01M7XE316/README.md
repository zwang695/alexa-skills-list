To use the UPS skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask UPS to track a package.*

* *where is the nearest UPS location?*

* *how much does it cost to ship a package?*

The UPS skill for Alexa gives you relevant information from UPS, using Amazon’s Echo, Tap or Dot. This skill allows you to track a package, find a location, get a shipping rate, and hear UPS’s latest stock price. No account authentication is required at this time. 

To track a package, you must speak a tracking number and Alexa will return the latest package status. You can say more info to receive additional details about the shipment. 

To find a location, you will provide your zip code and the bot will give you nearby UPS locations. 

To receive a shipping rate, you will need to provide the origin zip code, destination zip code and the weight of the package. 

You can also ask Alexa to tell you UPS’s stock price by saying stock while in the UPS skill.

We will be continually updating the UPS skill to provide new features so check back often to see what exciting things we offer in the coming months.
