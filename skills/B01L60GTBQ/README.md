To use the Light Bulb Jokes skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, tell light bulb jokes*

* *Alexa, ask light bulb jokes for a joke*

* *Alexa, say a joke from light bulb jokes*

Light bulb jokes were one of my favorite joke categories when I was younger but alas LED bulbs don't need replaced as often.  Go back in time to hear Alexa tell you light bulb jokes to get a quick laugh.
Alex, tell light bulb jokes!
