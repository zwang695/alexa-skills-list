To use the MySpellBuddy skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, Ask My Spell Buddy to spell slow down.*

* *Alexa, Ask My Spell Buddy one to spell forty.*

* *Change delay to two seconds.*

MySpellBuddy allows you to have Alexa spell out words or phrases with a 1 to 5 second delay between each spoken letter.  Just say "Alexa, Ask my spell buddy 1,  (or 2, or 3, or 4, or 5), to spell <word or phrase>".  If you don't include a valid number when you start MySpellBuddy, (i.e., "Alexa, Ask my spell buddy to spell <word or phrase>"),  it will default to a 2 second delay.

If you just start MySpellBuddy with no parameters, it will ask you "What do you want to spell?" You then respond with the word or phrase you want Alexa to spell.  Alexa will then spell the word with
the default 2 second delay.

This skill works best if you prefix the word or phrase you want to spell with the word "Spell".  For instance say "Spell forty" vs. just saying "Forty".

You can change the seconds to delay by saying "Change delay to 1, (2, 3, 4,or 5), seconds" .

If the word you want to spell is a command, you can say "Spell <command>".  For example:  "Spell stop" will spell "stop" where as if you just say "Stop", My Spell Buddy will exit.

Hint:  If the word you want to spell is a homonym, or Alexa has trouble understanding the pronunciation, try saying the word in a contextual phrase.  For example: "Spell how high" vs."Spell hi there". 

At anytime, you can say "help" for brief instructions.
