To use the Wheel of the Year skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open Wheel of the Year and ask for information on Samhain.*

* *Alexa, ask Wheel of the Year when Beltane is.*

* *Alexa, ask Wheel of the Year what colors are associated with Ostara.*

The Wheel of the Year is an annual cycle of seasonal festivals, observed by many modern Pagans. It consists of either four or eight festivals: either the solstices and equinoxes, known as the "quarter days", or the four midpoints between, known as the "cross quarter days"; syncretic traditions like Wicca often celebrate all eight festivals.

This skill brings you information on all eight Sabbats. The Sabbats are Samhain, Yule, Imbolc, Ostara, Beltane, Litha, Lammas, and Mabon.

You can also ask for the following correspondences: colors, foods, herbs, stones, and symbols.
