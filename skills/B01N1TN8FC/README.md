The Stoic Living skill provides insightful quotes and commentary by the great Stoic philosophers - Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, and Seneca. 

Their wise words can be used as a guide in your daily life as they focus on two big questions:
- How can we lead a fulfilling, happy life?
- How can we become better human beings?

The goal of Stoicism is to develop a peace within by overcoming adversity, practicing self-control, being conscious of our impulses, realizing our ephemeral nature and the short time allotted.
