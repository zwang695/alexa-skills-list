To use the American Trivia skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, Open American trivia*

* *Start new game*

* *My answer is one*

Use this game to test your knowledge on topics relating to the history of America. All the questions are based around American history, it's a trivia game so you might not know everything, but as you continue to play you will learn more, and you don't get all the questions every game so there is always something new to look forwards to. Once you open it, it will list instructions on how to play the game, you can ask it for help if confused and if you don't hear a question you can ask it to repeat, if you take too long to answer it will repeat itself.
