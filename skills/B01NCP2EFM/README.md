To use the Risky Rollers skill, try saying...

* *Alexa play Risky Rollers*

* *Roll dice*

* *End turn*

Risky Rollers is a simple dice game in which you play against Alexa. The goal of the game is to reach 100 points before the she does. On a turn, you roll the dice and add up the points shown. You can continue to roll to get more points, but if you get a one, your turn ends and you lose all of your points earned that turn. If you get double ones, you lose all of your points! When it is worth it to risk another roll is up to you.
