Alexa works together with the Weight Gurus app to act as your personal fitness coach. When you weigh in on your bathroom scale, you can ask Alexa to make a new entry in the Weight Gurus app by using commands like “Alexa, ask Weight Gurus to record 140 pounds.” Set your goal by specifying a target weight or an amount you want to lose or gain, and change that goal at any time. Find out how close you are to your goal weight by asking for updates, and celebrate important milestones along the way with a few words of encouragement.
