To use the World food skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask world food i want to eat somewhere else*

* *Alexa, ask world food im feeling global*

* *Alexa, ask world food lets try something new*

Love is spread through food and the world needs to feel the love. This skill gives you a random country from around the world to help you decide what to eat or cook tonight? Don't want to get Chinese again tonight? Maybe Alexa recommends Lebanese!
