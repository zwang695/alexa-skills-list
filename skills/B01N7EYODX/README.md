To use the Higher Self skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Higher Self to inspire me.*

* *Alexa, ask Higher Self to pray.*

* *Alexa, ask Higher Self for the latest intent*

Higher Self enables you to pause your busy life and focus your intention on spiritual thoughts and inspirations from individuals, just like you. The goal is to celebrate the diversity of our collective wisdom, unaffiliated with a specific religion or creed, enjoy a serendipitous passage to center our energy, and move forward in our daily life with purpose.
