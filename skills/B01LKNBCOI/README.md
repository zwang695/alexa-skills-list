To use the College Football Roster Info skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask College Football Info who wears number Two for Alabama.*

* *Alexa, ask College Football Info who is Watson for Clemson.*

* *Alexa, ask College Football Info about Daniel Jones for Duke.*

The College Football Roster Info skill lets you get information about any player on any team in the FBS by name or number. Simply ask Alexa about players by using their full name, last name, or number and their team and she will tell you key information about them like their height, weight, class and hometown. 
Note: information is current as of the start of the season, if you find numbers have changed let me know as the teams sometimes shuffle those in the first week or so.
