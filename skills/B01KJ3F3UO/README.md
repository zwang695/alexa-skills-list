To use the Fruit Nut skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Fruit Nut for the nutrition value of a watermelon*

* *Alexa, ask Fruit Nut what's in an orange?*

* *Alexa, ask Fruit Nut to tell me about strawberries*

Fruit Nut provides basic and approximate nutrition value information for fruit such as apples, bananas, oranges, and many more.  Depending on the fruit, this Alexa skill will give you information such as the number calories, fat content, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, and sugar content.  The information is provided to you in "practical units" (e.g., 1 apple, 1 slice of watermelon, a cup of grapes, etc.).

Please note that the actual values of real world fruit may differ significantly based on it's size and variation.
