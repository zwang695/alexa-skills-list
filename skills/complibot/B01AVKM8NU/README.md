To use the CompliBot skill, try saying...

* *"Alexa, open CompliBot"*

* *"Compliment Leia" (after launching)*

* *"Give me an insult" (after launching)*

You know how, sometimes, a nice word in the morning is all it takes to set your day on the right track?  Well, CompliBot has got your back!  It sees the best in you, and loves to share it!  

*Disclaimer: CompliBot may make you want to hug your Echo, and we fully support that.  However, using CompliBot as a shoulder to cry on may result in voiding your warranty if tears get in its circuitry - and is therefore not advised.
