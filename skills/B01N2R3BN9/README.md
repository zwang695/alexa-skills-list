How do you decipher a message from outer space sent 70 years in the past? And when you die in the digital age, what happens to the digital pieces you leave behind? General Electric Podcast Theater takes on those questions in The Message and LifeAfter, unpacking the mysteries of the Internet and the universe.

– Listen to episodes of The Message and LifeAfter
– Pick up where you left off, without missing a beat
– Pause, resume or skip episodes 

The Message
Follow the weekly reports and interviews of Nicky Tomalin, covering the decoding of a message from outer space received 70 years ago. Over the course of 8 episodes you’ll get an inside ear on how a top team of cryptologists attempts to decipher, decode, and understand the alien message.

LifeAfter 
When you die in the digital age, pieces of you live on forever. In your emails, your social media posts and uploads, in the texts and videos you’ve messaged, and for some – even in their secret online lives few even know about. But what if that digital existence took on a life of its own? Ross, a low level FBI employee, faces that very question as he starts spending his days online talking to his wife Charlie, who died 8 months ago…

But what feels like an unbelievable gift starts to bring up some very real moral and ethical predicaments, as Ross discovers LifeAfter, the program that brought his wife – and countless others back to life online. But what is “life” if you can be preserved digitally? And if you live online, where do you spend eternity?
