To use the The Cat Feeder skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask the cat feeder if we fed her?*

* *Alexa, ask the cat feeder about dinner?*

* *Alexa, ask the cat feeder if she is hungry.*

This skill allows you to check if you have fed your cat recently. Useful to have if your household contains several people that have different schedules and you want to make sure that at least somebody fed the cat before you left the house.

Usage is very simple, every time you ask Echo if you fed the cat feeder it will tell you the last time it was fed. Depending on your question and how long ago it was it will the follow up with a question of if you plan on feeding it now. If you say yes that is the new current time it has been fed. It assumes that the cat is hungry if it has not been fed in 6 hours.
