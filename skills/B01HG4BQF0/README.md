To use the Hangman Game skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open hangman game*

* *Alexa, play hangman game*

* *Alexa, start hangman game*

In this word game, Alexa chooses a word and tells the player how many letters are in it.  The player picks a letter from A to Z. Alexa tells the player if the letter is in the word, then spells the word, saying "blank" for any letters that haven't been guessed yet.
The player begins by saying "Alexa, play hangman game."  They can say "repeat" to hear the know letters again, "new game" to start over, "tell me the word" to hear the answer and quit, "goodbye" to quit, or "help" for more information.
