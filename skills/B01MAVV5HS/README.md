To use the Major System skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Major System how to remember five two*

* *Alexa, ask Major System what sound is associated with five*

* *Alexa, ask Major System how it works*

The Major System is a technique for easily remembering numbers. The way it works is that each digit from 0 to 9 is assigned a consonant sound and then you add vowel sounds to form words, so remembering the number is as easy as remembering the word.

For example, the sound "T" is assigned to 1, and "N" is assigned to 2, so you can add the vowel "I" and remember the number 12 with the word TIN.

If you're getting started with the Major System, you can ask what the sounds are for different digits, for example:

What is the sound for two?
What is the sound for six?

Once you know the sounds, you can ask how to remember any number:

How do I remember two five three?
How do I remember seven two?
