To use the Magic Podcast skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Magic Podcast to Play This American Life*

Magic Podcast uses the podcast search engine Audiosear.ch to find and play your favorite podcasts based on title or subject matter.   Use the Play command with the title of the show, "Play This American Life" or "Play Splendid Table".  The newest episode will play first followed by the rest of the shows in newest to oldest order.   Use the Find command to locate podcasts on a particular subject, "Find chocolate" or "Find television".   These will play in order of relevance.  You can skip through the episodes by saying "Alexa Skip".
