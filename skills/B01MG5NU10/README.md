To use the Festival skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, launch Indian festival*

* *Alexa, Open Indian festival and give me a fact*

* *Alexa, ask Indian festival to tell me a festival fact*

It will tell you some fun facts of certain festivals celebrated across the world.
Currently, it only has a few Indian Festivals. Soon there will add more.
