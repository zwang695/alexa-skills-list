To use the Robot Roxie skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open Robot Roxie*

* *Alexa, ask Robot Roxie to start game*

* *Pitch the ball*

Trying to keep score when you're playing baseball can be difficult, so why not use your Alexa and have it keep score for you?  

Roxie is a skill that tracks all of the basic information around a one-on-one pickup game.  Here are different features.

To begin, say "Start Game" and a new game will be initialized.  By default, the games are three innings long, and each player gets ten swings.

You can customize the player names by saying "Change Player One/Two name to <name>".

Say pitch ball and Roxie will track that a pitch was thrown.  Let Roxie know what happened next - either say "Strike, Ball, or Base Hit" and it will track the score.
