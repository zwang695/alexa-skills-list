To use the BSAdvisor skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open my advisor*

* *what do you think*

* *shut up*

This is an simple app only responds to you with negative point of view. It helps you reflect yourself and have a better idea of yourself. Later versions, I will add support multiple responses according to different request and introduce randomness.
