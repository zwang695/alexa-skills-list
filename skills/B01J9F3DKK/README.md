To use the Bedtime skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open bed time.*

* *Alexa, tell bed time I want to go to sleep at 8:00 pm.*

* *Alexa, tell bed time I need to wake up at 5:30 am.*

Bedtime counts sleep cycles to help time when you should go to bed or wake up. Waking up in the middle of a sleep cycle makes you feel tired but waking up in between cycles will make you feel energized and ready to spring out of bed.
