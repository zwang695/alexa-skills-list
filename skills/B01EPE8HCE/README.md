To use the Bug Tracker skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Bug Tracker what is the status for ticket CAMEL 1099?*

* *Alexa, ask Bug Tracker how many open tickets are there for project SPARK?*

* *Alexa, ask Bug Tracker how many tickets were closed since 15 days ago for KAFKA?*

Now you can query for the ticket status of any of your favorite open source projects, such as: Spark, Kafka, Cassandra or Log4j just to mention a few.

Just ask Bug Tracker the ticket number that you are interested in, and you will get all the relevant information related to the ticket.
