To launch the skill, say “Alexa, open Johnnie Walker.” After confirming you’re over 21 years old, you can select from 4 different options: Choose a Label, Buy a Bottle, Whisky 101, and Try a Guided Tasting.

In “Choose a Label”, you can find the perfect blend for yourself or a gift. Through a series of questions about flavor preference and price, Alexa will determine the proper whisky for your palate and offer relevant cocktail recommendations.

If you’d simply like to buy a bottle of Johnnie Walker, you can choose “Buy a Bottle” and Alexa will help you find the nearest store or delivery option.

When you select “Whisky 101”, Alexa will share a random fact about Johnnie Walker or whisky in general. These interesting tidbits make for clever cocktail conversation and provide an easy way to impress your friends.

In order to “Try a Guided Tasting”, you’ll need one of the core Johnnie Walker Labels on hand: Red Label, Black Label, Double Black, Green Label, Gold Label Reserve, Platinum Label, or Blue Label. Then, Alexa will conduct a personalized tasting based on the blend you choose. As you sniff and sip your way through the tasting, she’ll give helpful tips and ways to serve. 

While her Scottish needs work, Alexa offers an entertaining and insightful experience for both whisky beginners and experts alike. Say “ Alexa, enable Johnnie Walker” to get started now.
