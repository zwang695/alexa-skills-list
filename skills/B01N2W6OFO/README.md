To use the Nearby Aircraft skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open nearby aircraft*

* *Alexa, ask nearby aircraft for flights near Seattle, WA*

* *Alexa, ask nearby aircraft for nearby planes*

Ask Alexa for information about aircraft flying near you right now.

Tell Nearby Aircraft to find nearby aircraft around any zip code or city in the United States. Nearby Aircraft will respond with the three closest (within a 50 mile radius) aircraft's call sign, country of origin, distance from you, direction from you, direction of travel, speed, and altitude.

Note: Some locations may not have currently operating flight data receivers. For these locations, Alexa might say that there aren't any aircraft within 50 miles.
