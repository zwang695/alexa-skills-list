To use the Snowday skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Snowday is the federal government open today?*

* *Is the D.C. Metro delayed today?*

* *Are Baltimore City courts open today?*

Does the weather look grim outside this morning? Is there an ongoing emergency or special event in the DMV? Snowday provides information on closures/delays for various government offices and services and schools in the Baltimore/Washington area. It currently supports:
OPM (or "the federal government")
Maryland state government ("Maryland State")
The D.C. Metro ("the Metro")
The National Security Agency ("NSA")
Baltimore City Circuit Court ("Baltimore Courts")
University of Maryland, Baltimore (use "UMB")
Johns Hopkins University ("JHU")

...with many more on the way!
