To use the StockTrigger skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Stock Trigger to notify me on Amazon at 789.42*

* *quote Microsoft*

* *Alexa, ask Stock Trigger to add Boeing to my favorites*

Set price notifications on S&P 500 or Russell 1000 company stocks. You can set a trigger and get notified in realtime on your phone/email when your price thresholds are crossed. You can also get stock quotes and maintain your stock favorites. Careful though, our stock quote minion is very opinionated and with a complex personal life. Last but not least, StockTrigger lets you do limited Access/SQL like queries. You can find stocks that changed by specific percentages within the S&P index during last week/month or year. Enjoy.

- Tell Alexa to "Open Stock Trigger". You will get a list of available StockTrigger actions as a response.

- Set a US phone number to receive notifications by saying to Alexa "Set Phone (Your 10 digit phone number)". StockTrigger sends a verification link via SMS to make sure we got your phone number right. 

- Then set a trigger by saying for example "trigger Walmart at 75.43" or "Set notification on Mattel at 5 percent higher". You are now set up to receive a notification as soon as those prices are crossed.

- Get stock quotes in realtime by asking "Quote Microsoft" or "Quote General Motors".

- Add Favorites: Say, "Add Microsoft to my favorites". Get the quotes for your favorites by saying, "Get my Favorites". 

- Query for price changes: Say, "Find stocks where prices dropped between 6 and 7 percent last week". Or "Find stocks where prices increased more than 6 percent last month"

S&P 500 and Russell 1000 stocks are supported for now and a wider selection of stocks is in the works. Stay tuned at https://stocks.pricetrigger.com
