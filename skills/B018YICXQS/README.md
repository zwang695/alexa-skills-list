To use the AnyMote Smart Remote skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask AnyMote to pause my Sonos.*

* *Alexa, ask AnyMote to power off my TV.*

* *Alexa, ask AnyMote to volume down my XBMC.*

Control all your home electronics over Wi-Fi or InfraRed through the Smart IR Remote and AnyMote skill for Alexa. To use this skill, you need Smart IR Remote - AnyMote from Google Play or Apple AppStore. If you want to control devices that have infrared sensors (e.g., a TV, Set Top Box, AV equipment, etc.), you’ll need a phone that has an IR Blaster like the Galaxy S4, S5, S6, HTC One, LG G4 (Moto G, E, X and the Fire Phone don't have it), or an external IR Blaster accessory, like the AnyMote Home.  For more information and setup instructions, go to www.anymote.io/alexa  

Once you’re all set up and have your remotes added in the Smart IR Remote - AnyMote app, you can perform all the actions you’d normally perform through the remote - just by asking Alexa.
