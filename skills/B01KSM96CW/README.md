DESCRIPTION:
Ever been mad at Alexa but all she does is say nice things to you? Well no more! If you want Alexa to quit the B.S, stop playing nice with you, and just tell you what's really on her mind? Then you've come to the right skill. This skill gives Alexa a bit more personality.... She won't take crap from you and she WILL talk smack right back at you.
