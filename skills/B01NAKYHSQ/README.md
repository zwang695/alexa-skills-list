To use the Nostra Pompous skill, try saying...

* *Alexa Ask Nostra Pompous if I will ever get filthy rich*

* *Alexa Ask Nostra Pompus I will get married to a rich and handsome gentelman*

* *Alexa Ask Nostra Pompous if I will get pregnant soon.*

Nostra Pompous is based on *The White Magic Book*, a campy 1919 treasure that features outdated expressions and thinking. Nostra Pompous promises to either [A] answer your questions (usually with odd expressions that make fortune-cookie slips look like masterpieces of literature) or [B] leave you scratching your head. (Actually, a lot of the time, it will do both -- and, woohoo, it might also offend your modern sensibilities with its male-dominated perspective!) 
Hey, it doesn't get any better than this, right?!
