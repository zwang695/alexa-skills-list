To use the Flashtender skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Flashtender to start a new game.*

* *The answer is a martini.*

* *Restart.*

Flashtender is a collection of verbal flash cards for common drink names. It will list the ingredients in a drink recipe, and you will have to provide the name of the drink. When in doubt, use the full name of a cocktail (e.g., cosmopolitan instead of cosmo). 

To get started, ask Flashtender to start a new game!

Note: Flashtender is intended for adults of legal drinking age and, as such, might not be appropriate for all audiences. That means you, little Timmy.
