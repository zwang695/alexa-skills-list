Ask Alexa to turn on or off lamps, fans or whatever you have plugged into your iHome SmartPlug. Create groups to control multiple SmartPlugs with a single command.
After enabling the Skill you’ll be prompted to log in to your iHome account. Be sure to use the same account credentials used in your iHome Control app. To learn more about compatible iHome Control products visit: www.ihome.com
 
To get started, enable this skill and link your iHome account
Once your account is linked, discover your iHome SmartPlugs by telling Alexa to ‘Discover my devices’ or you can run discovery from the Alexa App.
 
After Alexa discovers your devices, just tell Alexa to turn on and off your iHome SmartPlugs.
For example, if your plug is named “office lamp” in your iHome app just say
 
                “Alexa, turn on the office lamp” or
                “Alexa, turn off the office lamp”
