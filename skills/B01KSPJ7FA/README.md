To use this skill, you need to purchase one or more Wireless Sensor Tags and an Ethernet Tag Manager (these are available at http://store.wirelesstag.net), and have created an account using our iOS app (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wireless-tag-list/id508973799), Android app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wirelesstag.android3) or the web interface (https://www.mytaglist.com/). 

A Wireless Sensor Tag can be used to find key attached to it using speaker inside each tag. 

Try saying:  "Alexa, turn on Car Key beeper,"  to help you find your key. 

Each tag also monitors and records motion events, temperature, humidity, ambient light, water leaks. 

Try saying: 
"Alexa, turn on Car Key motion," to enable motion sensor on the tag; 
"Alexa, turn off Car Key motion," to disable it; or if you have more than 1 tag with motion sensor, 
"Alexa, turn on all motion tags," to enable motion sensor on all tags when you leave home. 

You can also say...

"Alexa, turn on temperature monitoring in Bedroom."
"Alexa, turn on temperature monitoring in all tags." 

"Alexa, turn on humidity monitoring in Car Key."
"Alexa, turn on humidity monitoring in all tags."

Link a temperature sensor tag with a Nest or Honeywell thermostat in order to regulate temperature in a location different from where the thermostat is installed. AC or heat is turned on when tag temperature monitoring reports "too hot" or "too cold". Change either the "too hot" or "too cold" threshold temperature by saying:

"Alexa, set Bedroom temperature to 74."
