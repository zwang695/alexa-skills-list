To use the Holy Rosary skill, try saying...

* *Alexa ask Holy Rosary to pray the Joyful Mysteries*

* *Ask Holy Rosary to say the Glorious Mysteries*

* *Holy Rosary start the Sorrowful Mysteries*

Holy Rosary allows you to pray the Rosary along with Alexa. Simply say the name of the mystery you would like Alexa to pray and say ‘Amen’ after each prayer to continue. Alexa will keep the prayer count so you can focus on praying. 

In this first version you will need to say the name of the mystery you would like Alexa to pray (e.g. “Alexa ask Holy Rosary to pray the joyful mysteries). After Alexa says finishes the prayer, say 'Amen' to continue. 

As a reminder:

- Monday & Saturday – Joyful Mysteries
- Tuesday & Friday – Sorrowful Mysteries
- Wednesday & Sunday – Glorious Mysteries
- Thursday – Luminous Mysteries

The rosary will begin on the short strand with one "Our Father", Three "Hail Mary", and one "Glory Be". It will then continue with the first mystery.
