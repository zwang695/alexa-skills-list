To use the Easy Spelling Dictation skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Spelling Dictation to start*

* *Next word*

* *Repeat that word*

This skill helps people (especially those who are learning English) practice spelling. When the skill is launched, the user is given 10 words to spell, one at a time. After each word, there is a 9 second pause, then the user is asked if they need more time, or if they are ready to continue. Before launching the app, get a paper or notebook to write your answers, and when a word is spoken, write it down. At the end of the 10 words, you will be given the correct answers/spellings to check your work.
