To use the Jokes Galore skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open Jokes Galore*

* *Alexa, ask Jokes Galore tell me a joke*

* *Alexa, ask Jokes Galore say a joke*

The skill was built to provide Amazon Echo users with jokes that they might have heard of but haven't heard or have forgotten. As an added bonus I've included jokes of my own. Enjoy!
