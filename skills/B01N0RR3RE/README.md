To use the Maggie Tribute skill, try saying...

* *Alexa Open yer self*

* *Alexa Ask yer self*

Humor test app designed as a "thank you" Easter Egg for the person who gifted me their Echo.  Simple question/answer format that responds to a few key words, generally with praise for the person who sent the Echo and some self-deprecating humor about myself and her husband.
