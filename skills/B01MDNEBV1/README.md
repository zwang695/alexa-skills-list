To use the Local Earthquakes skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open local earthquakes*

* *Alexa, ask local earthquakes for quakes near San Francisco in the last month*

* *Alexa, ask local earthquakes for earthquakes near nine oh four oh five*

Local Earthquakes returns the top five earthquakes (sorted by descending magnitude) within 100 miles of a location input by the user (zipcode or US city over 100,000 people is supported).  The default time period is one hour, but you can override this by adding 'within ...' and specifying a time duration such as one week, 6 months, or one year.
