To use the Ambient Noise: Rain Sounds skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open Rain Sounds*

* *Alexa, tell Rain Sounds to play*

* *Alexa, ask Rain Sounds to loop*

Rain Sounds is an ambient noise loop of light rainfall - perfect to help you focus in a noisy environment, encourage relaxation, or create the perfect ambiance to fall asleep!

Want the sound to loop until you tell it to stop? Just say "Alexa, loop on" while the sound is playing, or start the sound by saying "Alexa, ask Rain Sounds to loop".

Looking for different sound loops? Search for "Thunderstorm Sounds" and "Ocean Sounds"!

*NOTE*: using the "play" invocation may not properly start the Skill, please use "open" or "ask" instead. Alexa has difficulty differentiating some audio Skill "play" requests from Amazon Music song "play" requests which is unfortunately beyond my control.
