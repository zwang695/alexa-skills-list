To use the BigBandTrivia skill, try saying...

* *Alexa ask Big band trivia to start*

* *Alexa ask Big band trivia to play*

* *Alexa ask Big band trivia to start a new game*

This is just for fun to help quiz people to see how much they know about big band music and hopefully to teach a little bit. Technically, the bands included here range over both traditional jazz big bands, as well as the later jump blues bands. These are all included in the broad/sometimes a little vague at the edges 'swing era.'
