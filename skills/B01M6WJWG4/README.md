To use the News Feed skill, try saying...

* *Alexa Ask News Feed What's the latest on Donald Trump*

* *Any news on Lebron James*

* *Play my top stories*

Ask ’News Feed’ for the latest on any topic and get live updates from the best news outlets, radio stations and podcasts in the world. 

When you first open News Feed Alexa will start playing your daily Top Stories - a selection of short live audio bursts selected from the most trusted and relevant audio sources. You can say "Next" to skip between each audio burst. 

Have a specific question in mind? Need to get the latest on your favorite NBA player? Just ask News Feed "what's the latest on" and your topic and get fresh, audio bursts in a close-to-live response time.

An email address is required during installation for personalization and updates - we will not use your email for any other reason.
