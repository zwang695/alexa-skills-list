To use the Before the Knot skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask wedding topics for a marriage topic*

* *Alexa, ask wedding topics to suggest a topic*

* *Alexa, ask wedding topics to ask us a question*

Marriage is difficult! It is even more difficult when you haven't discussed some of the most basic marriage topics. How many children do we want to have? How would we handle being broke? This skill is a fun way to get you and your partner talking about some of these topics. Simply ask Alexa for a wedding topic, discuss with your partner, then ask for another.
