To use the Play Blackjack skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, tell blackjack game to deal*

* *hit*

* *Alexa, ask blackjack game what should I do?*

This skill allows you to play rounds of blackjack, tracking your bankroll as you play.  You start with 5,000 credits and can vary your bet from 5 to 1,000.  This game allows you to hit, stand, split, double down, and even surrender.  In addition, you can "change" the options such as the number of decks (1, 2, 4, 6, or 8) or whether surrender is allowed or not.  In addition, you can ask for a suggestion on any hand ("what should I do"), and will be told the Basic Strategy play based on your cards, the dealer card, and the game options currently being used.

At any time, you can ask to "read the rules" or "repeat" to hear the current rules in play or to repeat your hand and bankroll.  If you need to reset the game to its original state and rules of play, say "open blackjack."
