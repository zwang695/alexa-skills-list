To use the Tennis Simulator skill, try saying...

* *Alexa Start tennis simulator*

This simple tennis match simulator will ask you for the first and last name of any two professional tennis players ranked in the top 300 as of 12/1/2016. It will then take those two players and simulate a match, giving you the final score result.

You can use this to run your own fictional tournament draws or look at upcoming matches and see who might win. It should not be considered an accurate predictor for gambling purposes.

Note that although the simulation algorithm is still in development, it is based on the player's overall performance in the last 12 months. It is not totally random.

You may match up men vs. women but the simulator is not intended to be used this way.

Make sure you use the player's first and last name. If you have trouble with Alexa recognizing a name, try pronouncing it phonetically.
