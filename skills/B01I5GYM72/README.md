To use the The Prayer Book skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask the prayer book to pray.*

* *Alexa, ask the prayer book to say grace.*

* *Alexa, ask the prayer book to bless this food.*

With the Prayer Book skill, Alexa can speak a mealtime prayer for you or your family. Even a quick prayer can be a meaningful connection to the God who loves us. Praying before your meal gives you an opportunity to give thanks for all you have, but itâ€™s also a much needed pause in your day. Life is hectic and sometimes we forget to pause, catch our breath, and lift up a few words of thanksgiving. Alexa makes it fun and easy! The Prayer Book includes a variety of succinct non-denominational Christian prayers. You can also use the brief prayers in the Prayer Book skill to model gratitude for the children and teens in your home, and to teach them new prayers.
