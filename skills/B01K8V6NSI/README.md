With Earplay, you can enjoy interactive audio stories you play with your voice, featuring voice acting and sound effects like in a radio drama. Experience this exciting new storytelling medium where you become part of the story, interacting with characters to affect how the events unfold. 

More is on the way, and for right now we have two short experiences for you to try out for free: the Earplay Demo and the Prologue chapter of Codename Cygnus. Email us at hello@ear-play.com to tell us what you think and let us know what you'd like to hear next!

THE EARPLAY DEMO
The Earplay Demo is an introductory demonstration of Earplay storytelling and style. It is written and hosted by the legendary Dave Grossman, Earplay's creative lead, and one of the most prominent interactive story writers in the games industry. To learn more about Dave and Earplay, visit us at http://ear-play.com

CODENAME CYGNUS
This is the Prologue chapter of the first ever voice-operated interactive audio story, a spy thriller where you play the secret agent. Originally launched in August 2013, eight chapters of the story have been released so far on mobile devices. Stay tuned, because we're planning to bring a new and improved version to Alexa soon.

STARTING EARPLAY
Once you enable our skill, you can use the invocation "Earplay" to go the welcome menu. Try saying it clearly as two words Ear Play if there's an issue. If Alexa has any difficulty understanding the way you say Earplay, go to the menu in the Alexa app, tap on Settings, and then tap Voice Training to start a session that helps Alexa to hear you better. Make sure you have enabled the skill first!
