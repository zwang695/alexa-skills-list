To use the The Motley Fool skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask The Fool for Apple.*

* *Alexa, ask The Fool how my watchlist is doing.*

* *Alexa, ask The Fool for a market update.*

The Motley Fool brings its easy-to-understand approach to Alexa. Once you enable the skill, simply request Alexa to "Ask the Fool for Apple," for example, and you'll get the share price and today's performance (and check your mobile app to see more data like trading volume, P/E ratio, and price range). If there are stocks you follow regularly (and sorry, for now we just cover stocks), it's easy to create a watchlist by adding and removing companies. Then, once you've built your list, just say, "Ask the Fool how my stocks are doing," and Alexa will report the overall movement of your watchlist and the day's biggest mover. It's a simple way to track your investments.
