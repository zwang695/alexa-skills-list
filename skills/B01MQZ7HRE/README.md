To use the Pig skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, play the game pig dice*

* *What's the current score?*

* *Quit playing*

Pig is a two-player dice game.

A player rolls the dice and adds the total on both dice to their score for this turn. The player can then "Roll" again, risking the loss of all their points from this turn, or "Stop," keep all their points from this turn and let the other player roll.

If any player rolls a one on either dice, they lose all the points from the current turn and the other player rolls. If any player rolls double ones, they lose all their points and the other player rolls.

The first player to reach 100 points wins.

Sample Instructions:
Continue your turn: "Roll", "Roll Again", "Keep Going"
End your turn: "Stop", "That's Enough", "Next Player"
Check the score: "What's The Score", "Score Report"
Stop the game: "Quit Playing", "Exit"
