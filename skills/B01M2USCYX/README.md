To use the Relative Keys skill, try saying...

* *Alexa start relative keys*

* *Alexa ask relative keys to give me information on c major*

* *Alexa ask relative keys to tell me about c minor*

Have Alexa join you at the piano and have her coach you about the keys.  Just ask her a key, like "D minor", and she will tell the details of the key signature (the accidentals) and the relative key.  A great practice companion.
