To use the quotes skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask daily thought to share something deep*

* *Alexa, ask daily thought to tell me something thought provoking*

* *Alexa, ask daily thought to give me an uplifting thought*

Similar to the quotes read out at the end and beginning of the tv show,CSI, this skill provides several positive apothegms to think about. 
These are aimed to improve one's spiritual and mental well-being by providing an alternative perspective in a stressful, chaotic world.
