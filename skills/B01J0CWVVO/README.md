There are quite a few games related to the bible, and Atheist Trivia contains lots of questions from the bible too. But these are ones that illustrate why many of the the fast growing demographic of "nones" do not believe in the supernatural as documented in ancient texts. This game, like many others, will ask five questions for each game, with four possible answers. You answer with the number of the answer you choose. Have fun!
