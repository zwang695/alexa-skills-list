To use the PoliticalGeek skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Political Geek for a government fact*

* *Alexa, ask Political Geek for a political fact*

* *Alexa, ask Political Geek to tell me a government fact*

Political Geek is here to entertain you with government facts and history. It is a great conversation started and history refresher on the details of our glorious country.

To get started all you have to do is ask Political Geek to tell you a government fact. For example:

"Alexa, ask Political Geek for a government fact"
"Alexa, ask Political Geek for a political fact"

I have fun learning interesting facts with Alexa about our government and it's history.
