To use the Status For Caltrain skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask caltrain checker for the status*

* *Give me the status*

* *What's Up*

I ride Caltrain. If you do too, you know it often runs into issues. Their updates are terrible, but a sentiment analysis of @Caltrain mentions on Twitter quickly lets you know if there has been a breakdown, accident, or worse.

Enable this skill (unaffiliated with Caltrain) to simply ask Alexa to rate the likelihood of something being really off with Caltrain. A higher score is worse. If it is over 25, you definitely need another transportation option!
