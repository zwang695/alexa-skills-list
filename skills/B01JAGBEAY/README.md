To use the VoiceMyBot skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask HipChat what happened*

* *Alexa, ask HipChat for notification feed*

* *Alexa, ask HipChat for user feed*

SoftServeâ€™s VoiceMyBot allows you to stay in touch with your team without opening a laptop or checking your smartphone. You can listen to recent messages from your teammates and check the status of recent production builds while working on something else. But the best way to use it is to integrate it with your ChatOps project room, configure your notification settings, and never miss a broken build, site crash, or messages from your boss again. At any time, you can listen to a user feed or a notification feed just by giving a simple command to Alexa. In addition, you can set up Alexa to build and deploy new versions of a website for production through a simple voice command. <br/>

From now on, you can talk with your bots, like a StarTreck captain at a command bridge, with VoiceMyBot as your second-in-command.
