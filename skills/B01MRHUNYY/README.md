Newsweek calls him "the world's best human guinea pig," and The New York Times calls him "a cross between Jack Welch and a Buddhist monk."  In this show, he deconstructs world-class performers from eclectic areas (investing, chess, pro sports, etc.), digging deep to find the tools, tactics, and tricks that listeners can use.

To pause an episode, you can say "Alexa, pause." When you're ready to start again, say "Alexa, resume." If you'd like to change episodes, say "Alexa, previous" for a prior episode or "Alexa, next" for a more recent one.
