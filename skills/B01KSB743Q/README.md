To use the Compliment Me skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, tell Compliment Me to compliment me.*

* *Alexa, ask Compliment Me to compliment me please.*

* *Alexa, ask Compliment Me for help.*

This skill will enable Alexa to compliment you, whether or not you actually deserve one. It's like a bag Sour Patch Kids - sometimes the compliments are sweet and sometimes they're sour.

*** WARNING ***
As stated above some of the compliments can be sour, as in this is not a skill for children. Please do not use with your young children and then be upset that it is not child friendly. Okay for teenagers with a sense of humor or perhaps(maybe...) babies who have no concept of the English language yet.
