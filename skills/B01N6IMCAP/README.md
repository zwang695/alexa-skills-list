Joke fairy is an unofficial joke search for reddit jokes. Ask joke fairy for a joke about any topic, and it will search several subreddits such as r/dadjokes, r/cleanjokes, and r/jokes for a joke that includes your search term. WARNING: the jokes may contain adult language and content. The joke may be very long or might contain content that isn't actually a joke, so just say "Alexa, stop" if it goes on too long. It's all part of the fun, you never know what you're going to get!
