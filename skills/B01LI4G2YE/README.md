To use the Feet2Meters skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask convert quick to convert three meters to feet*

* *Alexa, ask convert quick what is five feet to meters*

* *Alexa, tell convert quick to get meters from three feet*

Using Alexa Skill Kit and Lambda functions I created a simple converting between feet and meters skill. When you ask Convert Quick for a conversion between feet and meters it will do the calculation and then respond with the appropriate conversion and units. There is no pre-requisites for this skill. The purpose of this skill is to be  a quick and easy converting tool between the two most used measurements.
