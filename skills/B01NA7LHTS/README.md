If you're reading this, congrats! You've ended up with the long description. Wait! Don't stop reading! I promise I'll keep this interesting. Still here? Good. I am a sophomore in high school and I created this app in order to get a free hoodie. Don't judge me! It gets really cold! You try biking to school at 7:30 in the morning with only a light sweater. So please don't let my work go to waste and download my app. Although short, I promise that it'll be unique. And if you like it, please post some feedback and I'll make the sequel. Since I can't think of anything else to write, go and enjoy my app!
