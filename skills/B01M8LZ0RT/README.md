Provides live schedule information on a Northern Ireland direct train journey of your choice.
On first opening it will ask you for your start and end train stations and give you the upcoming trains with live schedule information.
The next time you start my train, simply by saying "Alexa, open My Train", it will remember your previously stored journey and give you the latest information.
To get the return trip of your stored journey use "Alexa, ask My Train for the return trip". This will not change your stored journey.
To store a new journey use "Alexa, ask My Train for a new trip". This will replace your previously stored journey.
Platform numbers are not read out initially but are shown on the card in the app. If you wish to hear them as well say "Alexa, ask My Train to set platforms on".
