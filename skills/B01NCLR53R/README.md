To use the Unofficial League of Legends Random Champ Picker skill, try saying...

* *Alexa Open champion picker*

* *Alexa Ask champion picker for a random champion*

* *Alexa Open champion picker*

I created this as a way to make ARAM style matches more fun. There isn't an easy way to pick random champions for a custom game at the moment so this allows for a group of friends to ask Alexa for a random champion that they can then play.
