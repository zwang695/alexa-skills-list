To use the Carpool Helper skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Carpool Helper, am I driving carpool today?*

* *What days do I drive carpool?*

* *Am I driving carpool tomorrow?*

This Alexa Skill can keep track of the days that you drive for your carpool and remind you in the mornings. Currently, it works with carpools based on days of the week (i.e. One person drives on certain days, and other drives on other days). The first time, the app will guide you through the setup process, then you can ask it if you are driving the carpool today, or if you are driving on a certain day (for example "Am I driving carpool tomorrow?" or "Am I driving carpool on August 10th?"
