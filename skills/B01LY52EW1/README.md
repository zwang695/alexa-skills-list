To use the Zipcode Lookup skill, try saying...

* *Alexa ask zipcode lookup to find zipcode 54241*

* *Alexa ask zipcode lookup find the zipcode for Madison, Wisconsin*

* *Alexa ask zipcode lookup what city has the zipcode 90210*

This service utilizes US Census zipcode data as well as Google's location services to try and find correct city names and get maps.

If the service does not recognize your city or zipcode, let me know in the reviews section and I will try to improve the recognition to resolve that information.
