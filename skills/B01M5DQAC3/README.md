To use the Revel Digital skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, my signage*

* *Ask my signage to show weather on lobby screen*

* *Ask my signage to tell me the status of lobby screen*

Use Alexa to command and control your network of Revel Digital signage and/or kiosk devices. Send a command to your player device by name and it will trigger a new schedule, advance a slide, or any other custom functionality available via scripting.

Give command such as:

Ask my signage to show weather on lobby screen.
Ask my signage to send update to menu board.
Ask my signage to tell me the status of lobby screen.

Commands are easily issued to player by name and can perform virtually any task. A great example would be using Alexa to control a kiosk where simple commands could be used to trigger different content sections.

This skill requires a Revel Digital account and at least one registered player device in that account. Registration is free and provides a 30 day trial period. For more information on the Revel Digital platform for digital signage please see: http://www.reveldigital.com.
