* *Alexa, ask Single Quote for the price of AMZN*

* *Alexa, ask Single Quote what is the quote for CSCO*

* *Alexa, ask Single Quote for FSLR*

Would you LUV to get the trading price of AMZN stock by speaking to Alexa?  Just give Single Quote a ticker symbol spelled out like "W O O F" and praise ZEUS, your quote will be sung to the heavens before the FIZZ  leaves your COOL drink.  It's a piece of cake.  MMM... CAKE.
