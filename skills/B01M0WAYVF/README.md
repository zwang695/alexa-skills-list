To use the Leo's Carbohydrate Fact List skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask leo's carb list to tell me a fact*

* *Alexa, open leo's carb list*

* *Alexa, tell leo's carb list to give me a carb fact*

Contains lists of foods, serving size, and how many grams are in those servings.  Also has a few general tips such as which food types are high-carb vs. low carb. Having to start watching carbs can be a bit dreary for some, so there's a bit of snarky humor here and there.
