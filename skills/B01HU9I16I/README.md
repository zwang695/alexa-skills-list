Securing and automating your home has become simple and intuitive with the LG Smart Security. Through the ADT Canopy mobile app, set up activities to create an automated home that suits you and the needs of your family. Then use Alexa to start those activities. Hosting a dinner party? Set up an activity that turns your lights down to create ambiance. Want your porch and foyer lights to anticipate your arrival? Create a "Home from Work" activity that sets them to the levels you choose. Start any Activity they create by simply asking Alexa to run it. 

Users can say "Tell Smart Security" then "run" or "start" followed by the activity name. Alexa will only be able to run activities that appear in a user's ADT Canopy Activity List.
