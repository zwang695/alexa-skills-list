To use the Fast Watch (StopWatch) skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open Fast Watch*

* *Time*

* *End*

This stopwatch skill will allow you to time your workouts and be able to record easily how long it took you to perform an workout. Once started the skill will need to be interrupted by saying the WAKE  word before asking for the time or to end the timer. 

FYI: Stopwatch was not specifically used because Alexa will not allow to you to complete the command because of her key words.
