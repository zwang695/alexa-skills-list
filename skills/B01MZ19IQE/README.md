Are you interested in learning how to play the piano? This skill will build up the skills for any novice looking to get started.

Level 1 - Basic Note Recognition
Say "Start Beginner Note Drill" and you can then get your hands set, then practice hearing individual notes, and trying to find them on a keyboard.  This is the first step towards understanding music.

Level 2 - Learn your first Song
Once you understand the notes, start with a basic song. Say "Teach Me Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" and the skill will walk through each note required to play.

Level 3 - Play a Duet with Alexa
Once you have mastered the sections, see if you can play the entire song along with Alexa in a duet. Just say "Duet for Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" and see if you can keep up and play all of the notes.
