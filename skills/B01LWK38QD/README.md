Welcome to Hive - Optimised for Smart Home.  This skill will enable you to ask Alexa to control your connected Hive devices.

New! You can now use your Echo and Amazon Alexa to control your Colour Changing Hive Active Light™. Using the Hive skill, you'll be able to use your voice to turn them on, off, and dim and brighten them!


With the Hive Smart Home Skill and Alexa, you can now interact with your Hive Active Heating™, Hive Active Light™, Hive Active Plug™ by voice. To get started, select the ‘Enable Skill’ button in this screen.  Then you need to link your Hive account and discover your device(s). Find more information about connecting Smart Home devices at http://amzn.to/291lR7u.

Here’s a handy list of commands you can use with Alexa and Hive to control your home:

Hive Active Heating™ 
(Using the name of your thermostat found during device discovery. The below examples the thermostat is named 'heating')

Alexa, set my heating to 20 degrees
Alexa, increase the heating 
Alexa, decrease the heating

Hive Active Light™
Alexa, turn on my light
Alexa, turn off my light
Alexa, brighten my light
Alexa, dim my light

Hive Active Plug™
Alexa, turn my plug on
Alexa, turn my plug off

When using the skill, you need to specify by name which device to use. There are two ways to control devices.

* Use the name you set up already – these are shown in the manage device section of your Hive app and can be changed there too.

* Create an Alexa group, such as Bedroom or Downstairs, and add the device(s) or sensor(s) to the group. More information is available at http://amzn.to/2965dCE.


To access more advanced functionality and features, ensure you enable the custom Hive skill. This is called 'Hive Complete'. You can find this by searching “hive” in the skill store. If you have any questions, please visit your dedicated Hive Alexa page at www.hivehome.com/Alexa
