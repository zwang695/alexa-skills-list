To use the L Train skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask the L Train when it's coming?*

* *Alexa, open the L Train.*

* *Alexa, ask the L Train to reset settings.*

Ask Alexa when the next train is coming to your NYC MTA L train stop, and listen to the current L train status. This app is simply for asking Alexa when the next L train is coming in a particular direction. For example, if you commute to work or school from Brooklyn to Manhattan everyday, Alexa will always be prepared to tell you when the next train is coming, and if there is any service changes you need to know about. After Alexa has guided you through the basic setup, you will get the next two trains that are on their way.

Your first time using The L Train, you will be walked through setting up your first train stop, and the direction on the train you regularly travel. If this is your first time using The L Train, you can just ask the L train when its coming by saying "Alexa, ask the L Train when it's coming". Alexa will than ask you for the L train station you use the most.  Example stations are; Jefferson Street, 3rd Avenue or Lorimer Street. After your station is recognized, Alexa will ask you for what direction you regularly travel. Example directions are; Towards Manhattan, Towards Brooklyn, West, East, Canarsie or To Eight Ave. Once we have all your settings, whenever you ask The L Train when its coming, you will get precise times to help you schedule your departure. 

If you would like to reset your settings, you can simply say "Alexa, ask The L train to reset settings". This will walk you through the startup process. If you fail to complete the startup process, you will be prompted to complete it on next use.

Once you are all setup, you can always just say "Alexa ask the L Train" or "Alexa open the L Train", or even "Alexa run the L Train" to get your train times in the fastest way possible. But you an always use more complete phrasing like, "Alexa, ask the L Train when it's coming?".

This skill works for every L train stop in New York City, including Brooklyn and Queens.
