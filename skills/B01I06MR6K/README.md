To use the Would You Rather skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Would You Rather for a question*

* *Alexa, start Would You Rather*

* *Alexa, ask Would You Rather for another one*

A very basic version of the game "Would You Rather?"  Ask Alexa for a question, and she will randomly select from our collection of over 300 odious options.

Some of these questions contain shocking content meant to inspire hilarious discussions.  Each question is guaranteed to provoke ridiculous fun, break the ice at any party, and start incredibly interesting conversations!

DISCLAIMER:  Some of the questions may contain content not suitable for children.  If this game were a movie, it would be rated PG-13.
