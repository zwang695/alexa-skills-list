Welcome to the advanced Hive skill for Amazon Echo.  This skill will enable you to ask Alexa to control your connected Hive devices.

New! You can now use your Echo and Amazon Alexa to control your Colour Changing Hive Active Light™. Using the Hive skill, you'll be able to use your voice to turn them on and off!


To get started, make sure that your Hive Hub and (Hive devices) associated devices are connected and online.  You’ll then need to enable the Hive skill by tapping ‘Enable skill’ at the top right of this screen.  After the skill is enabled, you'll be asked to provide your Hive login details so that Alexa can control your devices for you. 

Here’s a handy list of the commands you can use to control your home with Alexa and Hive. These will be updated as we add more!

We’ll continually improve the skill to ensure you’re getting the most from your Hive Connected Home. We’re already working on adding more features, and if you’d like to give us your feedback on what you want to see next from Hive head to www.hivehome.com/Alexa
