To use the Trumpet Fingerings skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Trumpet Fingerings how to play B flat.*

* *Alexa, ask Trumpet Fingerings for low B.*

* *Alexa, use Trumpet Fingerings to get D sharp 5.*

Use Trumpet Fingerings to figure out which valves to press for a given note on a standard, concert B♭ trumpet. Supported notes range from low F♯ three lines below the staff to high D on the third space above the staff. Ask for standard note names like "A" and "A flat," trumpet range notes like "low F sharp" or "high C," or in scientific pitch notation like "G4" or "G sharp 4," ranging from F♯3 to D6.

The same fingerings also apply for mellophones, B♭ cornets, and flugelhorns.
