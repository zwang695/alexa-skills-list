To use the Olaf's Havamals skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Olaf Odinsson for some Viking Wisdom*

* *Alexa, ask Olaf Odinsson for number thirty.*

* *Alexa, ask Olaf Odinsson for a Havamal*

Hávamál ("sayings of the high one") is presented as a single poem in the Codex Regius, a collection of Old Norse poems from the Viking age. The poem, itself a combination of different poems, is largely gnomic, presenting advice for living, proper conduct and wisdom.
The verses are attributed to Odin; the implicit attribution to Odin facilitated the accretion of various mythological material also dealing with Odin.
