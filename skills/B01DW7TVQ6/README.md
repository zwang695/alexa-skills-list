To use the InControlHA skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask InControl to activate the scene leaving home.*

* *Alexa, ask InControl to turn off the kitchen light.*

* *Alexa, ask InControl to turn off the bedroom light in 15 minutes.*

Control your home automation devices, including z-wave, Philips Hue, Nest and Sonos. Lights, devices and scenes can be activated using voice control. You can also turn lights on or off after a delay, such as 10 minutes.

You will need to have InControl server running on your home computer and have it pre-configured to control your home automation devices. Your InControl server must also be linked to your InControlHa.com account.

To get started, say "Alexa, ask InControl to link my account." You'll be given a short 5-letter code that you can enter at http://www.incontrolha.com/alexa. If you miss your code, visit your Alexa app to find it or repeat the question to Alexa.
