To use the Bird Song skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Bird Song for a blackbird*

* *Alexa, ask Bird Song to surprise me*

* *Alexa, ask Bird Song for a game*

Bird Song is a serene and entertaining skill that plays hundreds of different bird songs and calls.  You can ask for a specific bird ("Alexa, ask Bird Song for a melodious blackbird"), a general bird ("Alexa, ask Bird Song for a blackbird"), or have Alexa select a random bird for you ("Alexa, ask Bird Song for a random bird").

For even more fun, ask Bird Song for a game to see how good you are at identifying birds by their voice alone.
