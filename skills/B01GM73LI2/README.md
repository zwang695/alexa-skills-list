To use the Pet Bed Time skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Sand Man to tell the cat to go to bed*

* *Alexa, ask Sand Man to tell the dog to go to bed*

* *Alexa, ask Sand Man to tell the pets it is time for bed*

If your household is like ours, your pets don't listen to you when you tell them to go bed.  Now, with a little help from the sandman, Alexa's authoritative voice will convince them it really is time for them to go to bed.

You can ask at any time, and the sandman will always tell them it's bedtime.
