To use the Chinese Zodiac skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask the Chinese Zodiac to tell me the sign for people born on May 29th, 1977*

* *Alexa, ask the Chinese Zodiac to tell me about Monkeys*

* *Alexa, open the Chinese Zodiac*

In Chinese astrology, the year you were born determines the animal sign you were born under. Are you a Snake? Wise, intense and passionate? Or maybe you were born in the year of the Goat. Gentle and considerate, timid and maybe a little vain?

Tell me the year you were born and I will tell you your sign and the personality traits most often associated with people born in your year.
