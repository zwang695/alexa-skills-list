To use the 4AFart skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, Ask For A Fart*

Just have Alexa ask for a fart and watch hilarity ensue as she lets one rip. With random  farts of varying levels of repugnance, there's never a dull moment!

You'll be provided with hours of entertainment and education for the whole family. Granny will love it and best of all, these air biscuits will not drive you out of the room!

Note: Expert users with precision timing may want to try this amusing gag: Just wait until you have to let one loose, then call on Alexa to do the deed - and blame it on her!
