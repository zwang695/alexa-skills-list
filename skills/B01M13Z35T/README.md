Is your dog staring at you? And you have no idea what he wants? Just ask Alexa what does buddy want and she will ask your dog for you. It has trigger words such as, pee, poo, water, food, and treat.

Hopefully your dog will react to one of Alexa's question and you can finally understand your dog better.
