To use the What Board Game to Play skill, try saying...

* *Alexa launch board game picker*

* *tell me more*

* *play again*

This is an Alexa skill to help my tabletop gaming friends decide what to play. This is based on my personal game collection, but you can apply the suggestions provided to your own collection.

Alexa will ask 'yes' or 'no' questions to gather information and give you a suggested board game. If you do not like the suggestion, you are able to 'play again' to get a different suggestion. Mostly intended for groups that have many newcomers to board and tabletop games.

Game titles used within the app are owned by their respective publishers.
