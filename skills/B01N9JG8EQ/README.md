To use the Word Associations skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, play Word Associations*

* *Alexa, open Word Associations*

What word is related to all three of the following: cottage, swiss, cake? The answer is "cheese"! 

The rules are simple: quickly say a word that is related to all three of the words given by Alexa. If you don't know the answer, just say "I don't know". You can also ask Alexa to skip or repeat a question.

The words come from the Remote Associates Test, which is a test of creative potential used in psychological studies.
