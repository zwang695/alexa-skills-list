* *Alexa, tell Tip of Tongue to play a game.*

* *Alexa, ask Tip of Tongue for rulebook.*

Tip of Your Tongue is a competitive game in which you answer questions using a word or short phrase that begins with a random generated letter. 

Each game, or round, consists of questions, a random letter and a time interval. Every player will need something to write with and on (paper, pen, phone, whiteboard, etc). When the round begins a random letter will be chosen, the following questions must be answered using a word that begins with that letter. For example if the letter is F and the question prompt is "a car manufacturer" you could answer Ford. 

At the end of the round, review each line of every player. If two or more players have the same answer, they are offset and no points are awarded. Answers can be challenged and ruled invalid by majority vote. For example, if the prompt was "Television Show" and the answer was "Band of Brothers", majority vote may argue it was an HBO miniseries and lose that point.

You can play winners per each game or round, or have multiple rounds and add the totals of all the round, say 3 rounds. 

You may play with default or custom settings. Default consists of 10 questions with 10 seconds between each question. Custom settings give you the option to choose between 1 and 20 questions and choose a difficulty; easy (15 seconds), medium (10 seconds) and hard (5 seconds).

Rules and instructions can be accessed by asking "Alexa, ask Tip of Tongue for the rulebook."

There is currently a 161 question word bank.

There is no limit to the amount of players.
