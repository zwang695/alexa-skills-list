To use the Resistor Buddy skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Resistor Buddy what is the value of green yellow and brown.*

* *What are the colors with the value of one hundred ohms?*

* *Tell me the colors of a resistor with the value of ten k ohms.*

Resistor Buddy helps you calculate the value of a resistor based on its colour bands and vice versa. Never have to look up a resistor code chart again! Simply ask "how many ohms is a resistor with the bands brown, black, orange, and gold?" or "tell me the bands with the value of 220 ohms".
