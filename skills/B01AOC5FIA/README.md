To use the NYC Transit skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask NYC Transit what is the status of 7?*

* *Alexa, ask NYC Transit what is the status of Alpha?*

* *Alexa, ask NYC Transit what is the status of Bravo?*

New York City subway system is not reliable sometimes, so ask Alexa before you head to the station!
You can ask me New York City subway status. Like:
What is the status of 7?
For alphabetical trains, like A, C, E trains, use a word that begins with that alphabet instead.
This is to improve voice recognition.
For example, for A train, say:
What is the status of Alpha?
For B train, say:
What is the status of Bravo?
NATO phonetic alphabets are recommended:
A for Alpha.
B for Bravo.
C for Charlie.
D for Delta.
E for Echo.
F for Foxtrot.
G for Golf.
J for Juliette.
L for Lima.
M for Mike.
N for November.
Q for Quebec.
R for Romeo.
S for Sierra.
Z for Zulu.
Also, you may say Shuttle for S train.
And, please say the full name: Staten Island Rail, not S. I. R., for Staten Island Rail.
