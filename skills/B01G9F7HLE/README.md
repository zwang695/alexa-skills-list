To use the Luma WiFi skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Luma WiFi to pause*

* *Alexa, ask Luma WiFi to resume*

* *Alexa, ask Luma WiFi to prioritize my device*

Luma creates an outrageously-fast, ultra-secure Surround WiFi network thatâ€™s customized for your home. Luma allows you to pause all devices assigned to a specific user on your network.  If a device is unassigned (i.e. your smart thermostat or security cameras) the pause feature has no impact on those devices. Luma also lets you prioritize a device, giving it the fastest connection to the internet. In order to take advantage of these great features, you must have one device from the Amazon Echo family of devices and a Luma Surround WiFi system.

How to use Alexa to control your Luma Surround WiFi:

* Open your Alexa app.
* Enable Luma WiFi skill
* Account linking required
* You can: Pause and unpause your network's WiFi on demand.   Pause and unpause a default user and their default devices (configured in the Luma app settings).  Prioritize and remove priority of default device (configured in the Luma app settings).
