The Smartika Skill complements your existing Smartika Ecosystem, allowing you to use voice commands to alter, or dim, the lights, and activate scenes. 

To provide you with the best experience possible, we’ll need you to:

2.	Create a Smartika account using the mobile app. 
3.	Follow the on-screen instructions to setup the hub and pair your devices.

Once you’ve created your Smartika account and setup your devices, you’ll need to link the Smartika Alexa Skill with your account. To do so, follow the instructions:

2.	Click on ‘Enable Skill’, followed by ‘Link Account’.
3.	Log in, using your Smartika Account. 
4.	Authorize the Smartika Alexa Skill app to access your account. 

The Smartika Alexa Skill should now be able to discover all of your devices. 
5.	Click on ‘Discover Devices’, or say, “Alexa, discover my devices”.

For example, you can set ‘Office Lights’ to 30%, by saying, ‘Alexa, set Office Lights to 30%’. 
-You can increment lights by a specific percentage. 
For example, you can increment ‘Office Lights’ by 15%, by saying, ‘Alexa, increase Office Lights by 15%’.
