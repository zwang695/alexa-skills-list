Cinemate is a powerful movie search skill that allows you to access all kinds of movie information.  With your voice you can ask it to tell you a movie's plot, director, release date, run time, composer, cast and so much more.  You can now ask it where a movie is available for streaming.  Cinemate searches through the four main subscription streaming sites: Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and HBO Now (same as HBO Go).  More sites coming soon.  

Cinemate also remembers what movie you have selected and will be able to properly answer questions like "Who's in it?" or "Where can I watch it?"

Another key feature is the ability to ask for the common movies between two actors.  

This latest version comes equipped with the ability to search for a movie's streaming source as well as an improved search mechanism.  Advanced text comparison logic is now used to find the result that best matches the title or actors you asked for.  If more than one result are equally good, Cinemate will read them back to you and allow you to pick which one you want.  

Finally, all of your movie information needs are fulfilled in one single skill that is intuitive and friendly to use.  What are you waiting for.  Enable the skill and give it a try.
