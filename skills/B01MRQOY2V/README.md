To use the Find the Day skill, try saying...

* *Alexa Start Find the Day*

* *My answer is Thursday*

This skill will give you a date and ask you to determine the day of the week for that date. There are several rounds that you can pass as you get better:  

Round #1) Dates for this month
Round #2) Dates for this year
Round #3) Dates for this century
Round #4) Dates between the year 1600 and 3000

See https://www.soa.org/News-and-Publications/Newsletters/Compact/2013/july/Mental-Math.aspx  for a recommended method for doing the mental calculations.
