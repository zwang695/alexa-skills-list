To use the San Francisco Transit Predictions skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open s. f. transit*

* *Alexa, ask s. f. transit when the next N is coming for thirteen nine eleven*

* *Alexa, ask s. f. transit when the N is arriving at stop thirteen nine eleven*

San Francisco Transit Predictions gives you the next arrival for the route and stop you specify.

- when is the next {Route} arriving for {StopId}
- when is the next {Route} for {StopId}
- when is the {Route} coming for {StopId}
- when the {Route} is coming for stop {StopId}
- when the {Route} is arriving at {StopId}
- when the next {Route} is coming at {StopId}
- when the next {Route} is arriving at stop {StopId}
