To use the My Lawn skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask my lawn how much water it needs.*

* *Alexa, ask my lawn how much I should water.*

* *Alexa, tell my lawn my zip code is 78701*

Alexa accesses your local weather to provide watering and mowing advice for your lawn. Based on how much rain you received, Alexa tells you how much to water your lawn and how to adjust your sprinkler settings. Alexa also uses your local temperature to determine what height you should mow your lawn.

Begin by telling Alexa to "open my lawn"

Note: Currently this skill only supports St. Augustine grass.
