The Dice Game.
A game played with six virtual dice and up to ten players sharing the same Alexa enabled device. (Not online players)
The object of this game is to be the first player to score exactly 10,000 points. 
Say the "Roll" command to roll the dice. 
Your roll is scored as follows:                                                                                                                         
Each one is worth 100 points. Three ones are worth 1000 points.                                                                                                                            
Four ones are worth 2000 points and five are worth 4000. 
If you roll six ones in a single roll you automatically win the game.                                                                                                                          
Each five is worth fifty points.
Except for ones, any value rolled in multiple of three or more are scored as follows:
For three of a kind, multiply the value times 100.
Four of a kind is the value times 200.
Five of a kind is the value times 400 and six of a kind is multiplied by 800.
For example, rolling four threes would give you 600 points.
If none of your dice score points your turn is over (busted!).
If points are scored you can elect to end your turn and collect the points you've scored OR roll any unscored dice again.
Once again, if no points are scored your turn is over and any points you've scored in that turn are lost.
If all the dice you roll score points you MUST roll all six dice again.
To enter the game, and accumulate points, you first must score 600 points in a single turn.
If you elect to end your turn with some unscored dice left. The next player, if that player has scored the required 600 points, has the option to continue your roll using your unscored dice.
If successful that player will accumulate the score the previous players turn and may continue from there.
If you roll a score that would bring your total over 10,000, your turn is over and no points are scored.
The roll is considered dead at this time and the next player does NOT have the option to continue your roll.
The first player to reach exactly 10,000 points WINS!!

The game commands are:
Roll:  Roll the available dice and determine the score.
Pass:  Pass the dice to the next player (say this to end your turn and collect your points, if any)
Score:  Alexa will tell you your score.
