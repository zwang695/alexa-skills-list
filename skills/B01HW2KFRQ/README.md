To use the shark facts skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask professor shark for a shark fact*

* *Alexa, ask  professor shark to share a shark fact*

* *Alexa, ask  professor shark to give me a shark fact*

In honor of Discovery's shark week, I put together several facts about sharks.  To help reduce the erroneous myths about sharks, these facts are aimed as an educational resource and to appreciate the truly amazing and even bizarre characteristics of sharks. I provided some information about sharks that some people may have never heard of before such as the goblin shark and the ninja shark.
