To use the What Diet Decision skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, start what diet*

* *tell me more*

* *play again*

What diet will ask you a few questions, and based upon your responses, recommend a diet type for your consideration. There are two types of questions. First are related to issues where diet choices can make an impact. Second are related to types of foods you are willing, or not willing, to forego to effect that impact. After the recommendation is made, you may say, tell me more, to hear a short description of the recommended choice.
