The Home Control Assistant is a full featured Home Automation application. This skill is the voice interface to the HCA Server running in your home. Using HCA you can control, program, and schedule lights and appliances using many popular automation protocols. 

Unlike other home control systems, HCA is designed not to just control your home but also to program it. You don't need to accept the simple "control a device" using voice offered by some automation solutions. Using HCA you can create an automation solution that responds to your needs by combining multiple device in complex scenarios involving events, time, location, state of the home, etc. into one program. These programs express your intent of how your installation should work.

In addition to voice control, HCA offers clients for the iPad, iPhone, Android devices, and WIndows. With these client applications you are not locked into an application that displays as it wants to. You can create the page structure you see when interacting with the HCA client on your mobile device.  This can be configured on a device-by-device basis and on a user-by-user basis.  For some users, the display can show a complete set of pages for each room. For other users it can display a smaller set of only selected devices. For least technical users you can create a simple keypad like interface that offers only those actions you want to make available for them.

In one inclusive package HCA provides for creation and operation of simple to complex automation designs.
