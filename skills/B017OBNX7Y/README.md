To use the Angry Bard skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Angry Bard for a burn.*

* *Alexa, launch Angry Bard and tell me about it.*

* *Alexa, tell Angry Bard to slander me.*

Have at you, knave! The Angry Bard skill is ready to throw barbs from the Bard anytime you like. Each insult is a quote selected from among the works of William Shakespeare, given together with the name of the piece from which it's taken. A text copy of the quote and its source are also sent to the Alexa app.

Note that because this skill includes Elizabethan-era strong language, it may not be suitable for all ages.
