To use the Chicago Bike Share Status skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Chicago Bikeshare how many bikes are at the Ashland Avenue and Grand Avenue station.*

* *Alexa, ask Chicago Bikeshare to check my commute.*

* *Alexa, ask Chicago Bikeshare to store an address.*

This skill lets you check the status of stations in the Chicago Divvy bike sharing network. You can request the number of bikes, docks, or both from any specific station. Use the station name, such as "Orleans Street and Elm Street" or "Adler Planetarium" to make the request. Station names are displayed at the stations themselves and on the Divvy website. The names are generally either the nearest cross-street or a nearby significant landmark. If you only remember one street name, you can say "Alexa, ask Chicago bikeshare what stations are on Grand" (or whatever the street is) for a list of all stations on that street.<br>
<br>
To easily check the status of stations you use every day, the Chicago Bikeshare skill will let Alexa remember an origin and destination address. If you choose to store an address, Alexa will be able to give you the number of bikes available at the station closest to your origin and the number of docks at the station closest to your destination. If there's not many left, it will also check the next nearest station.<br>
<br>
Ask Alexa to remember a new address with "Alexa, ask Chicago bikeshare to save an address", or change an existing address with "Alexa, ask Chicago bikeshare to change an address". You can also refer to your origin address as "home", and your destination as "work" or "school".<br>
<br>
Once Alexa remembers your origin and destination addresses, all you need to do is to say "Alexa, ask Chicago bikeshare to check my commute", and you'll know if you need to use your backup station!<br>
<br>
You can always check what address(es) you have stored with, e.g., "tell me which home address is saved". Remove all stored addresses by saying "remove my addresses".<br>
