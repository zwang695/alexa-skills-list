To use the Mind Maze skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open mind maze*

* *dimension two*

* *south*

Our complex and tricky mazes are challenging to solve. But once you get good at navigating north, south, east and west, you can then up the difficulty by adding up and down for a three dimension maze. And since the power of your mind, and our voice interface, knows no limit, you can then move on to master four and five dimension mazes!
