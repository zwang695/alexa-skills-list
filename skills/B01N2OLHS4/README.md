* *Alexa launch priority board*

* *delete phone bill from the list*

* *add phone bill to the list*

Priority Board helps you get things done. Research shows that focusing on one task at a time is the best way to get things done.  Priority board only lets you add a few items to your task list and if you're not done by the end of the day, your tasks reset.  In this way, you'll have to ask yourself "Am I working on the most important task, right now?".  Complete your tasks and tell Priority Board you're done.
