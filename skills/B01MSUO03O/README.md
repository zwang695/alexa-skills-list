To use the Plume Labs skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Plume for pollution level in Los Angeles today*

* *Alexa, ask Plume how is the air in San Francisco now*

* *Alexa, ask Plume to give the particulate matter level right now in Houston*

Just like the weather, pollution levels can vary greatly over the course of a day. With the Plume skill, you can now track live air quality metrics in your city and stay one step ahead of harmful pollutants.

Plume provides the overall air quality level (moderate, high, very high, etc.), along with further detail about individual pollutant levels (particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen dioxide) and our Plume Index.

You already plan your day to make the most of the sunshine - now you can make the most of clean air too!
