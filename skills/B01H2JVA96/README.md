To use the Star Archives skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask star archives tell me about Luke Skywalker.*

* *Alexa, ask star archives who is Luke Skywalker.*

* *Alexa, ask star archives get information for Luke Skywalker.*

Star Archives is your source of information for the world of Star Wars including characters, planets, starships, or film. Learn more about your favorite pop culture phenomenon...

To start the skill you can say either of the following:
1. "Alexa, start Star Archives"
2. "Alexa, ask Star Archives"

Once activated, you can begin asking Alexa questions like, “tell me about Luke Skywalker?” And then follow up with other questions for more details about the subject, such as, “What is is his hair color?”, “How tall is he?”, “What films has he been in?”, and so on. 

You can ask Star Archives about a character’s homeworld, films, species, and attributes. You can even ask the Archives about specific starships such as, manufacturer, cost, speed, and size. 

You can also ask questions about each of the seven Star Wars films. The skill will fetch a description or the “opening crawl” of that particular film.

Lastly, if you’re thinking about traveling to a galaxy far far away then you might want to ask the Star Archives questions about the planets you want to go to like climate, terrain, population, famous residents, and orbital period. And if you want to leave the Archives, say "stop", "cancel", or "never mind".
