To use the Red Stick Transit skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, Ask Red Stick about stop 1344.*

* *Alexa, Ask Red Stick about stop one thousand three hundred forty four*

* *Alexa, Ask Red Stick about Government at Edison West*

Get the same bus number, route information and predicted arrival time that is available from the CATS website https://www.brcats.com/using-apps-route-shout

You can get a complete list of stop names and IDs here: http://cats.garden-district.com/rsStopList.php

Most stop names indicate the direction of travel, so you will need to indicate that when asking by name, ie, Government at Edison West 

The direction of travel is not needed when asking about a stop ID or number.
