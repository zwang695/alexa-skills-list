To use the Lyft skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Lyft for a ride.*

* *Alexa, ask Lyft how much a Lyft Plus from home to work costs?*

* *Alexa, tell Lyft to rate my driver five stars.*

Need a lift? With the Lyft skill for Alexa, you can request a ride and get picked up in minutes from the home address set in your Lyft account. If you've set a work address, your weekday commute can be a breeze, too. Instead of hailing a cab or waiting for the bus, just request a car with your voice. Lyft is cheaper than a taxi, faster than the bus, and easy to use.
 
To get started, enable the skill and link a Lyft account. Then just ask

    - "Alexa, ask Lyft to call a line to work for 2 people."
    - "Alexa, ask Lyft where my ride is"
    - "Alexa, tell Lyft to rate my driver 3 stars."
    - "Alexa, ask Lyft how long getting a line to work will take."

Lyft for Alexa uses the Work and Home addresses you've specified inside your Lyft App. Lyft for Alexa will always send a car to your Lyft 'Home' address.
