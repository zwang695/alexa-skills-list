To use the Chicago Java skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Chicago Java when is my next Meetup.*

* *Alexa, ask Chicago Java when is my next meeting.*

* *Alexa, ask Chicago Java when is my next event.*

This skill allows you to get information about some meetup like events that are held in Chicago. For now it pulls the events from the Chicago Java User Group Meetups. The skill will tell you how many Meetups are scheduled and will give some information about the first coming up.

Find more information about the Chicago Java User Group at this page: http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoJUG/

This skill is completely open source and will be available really soon on my github : https://github.com/corelema
(I will update the URL as soon as I am done cleaning/uploading the project).
The goal is to have a skill that can give the Meetups from one's Meetup's account. I started with a static reference to the Chicago Java User Group as I am part of it, and as this skill is fully written in Java.
