Hamurabi is one of the first games made for terminal computers. In Hamurabi you manage a kingdom. Each year you must carefully balance how many bushels you'll use to feed your workers, and how much you'll plant for the next year. With famine years, plagues, and rats, it'll be a challenge to prevent revolts and prepare for the next year.
