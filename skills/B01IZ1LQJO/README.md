To use the Rational 8-Ball skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Rational Eight Ball if I should go to work*

* *Alexa, ask Rational Eight Ball if I am going to win a million dollars*

* *Alexa, ask Rational Eight Ball where my keys are*

This skill is an ironic twist on the magic 8-ball game.  Instead of variations of Yes, no, or maybe, users will get a Neil deGrasse Tyson quote.  You can ask it questions as you would a magic 8-ball.

This skill is an homage to Dr. Tyson's work.  The quotes are a mixture of science, philosophy and humor that are pulled from books, interviews, twitter, and podcasts.  Below are some links for more information.
