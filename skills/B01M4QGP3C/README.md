Lutron Connect works seamlessly with Alexa to provide whole home control of your lights, shades and temperature via scenes in your Lutron RadioRA2 or Lutron HomeWorks QS system. *

You — or anyone in your family—can tell Alexa to turn on or off your favorite scenes selected from buttons throughout your home.  Just use the Lutron Connect App to select, update, and name your favorite scenes for Alexa.  Once you know the name of your scenes, you can use the 'turn on' and ‘turn off’ commands to activate them. For example, you can say "Turn on movie mode" or "Turn off living room".

More information is available in the Lutron Connect Alexa FAQ at http://tinyurl.com/connectalexa. 

*NOTE – A Lutron Connect Bridge is required for Alexa to work with RadioRA2 and HomeWorks QS systems. For best performance, version 10.6 or higher of RadioRA2 or HomeWorks QS system software required. If you have any questions or run into any issues, please contact your Lutron service provider for assistance.
