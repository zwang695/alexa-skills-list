To use the One Card Poker skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, play One Card Poker*

* *Alexa, start One Card Poker*

* *Alexa, ask One Card Poker to deal*

Play a fast-paced one-card poker game (also known as Blind Man's Bluff) against Alexa!

Alexa will deal herself a card and reveal it to you. Your goal is to guess if the card she will deal you is higher than her card. If you think your card will be higher, you choose to "stay". If you think your card will be lower, you choose to "fold". 

Try to get a perfect score by guessing a full deck of card deals correctly!
