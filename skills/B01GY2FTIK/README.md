To use the Box of Cats skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open the box of cats*

* *Alexa, ask the box of cats what the cat says*

* *Alexa, ask the box of cats to talk to my cat*

Ask Alexa to open up a box of cats! You can't see the box (duh), but you'll hear whatever cute, cuddly animal comes out of it. Most of the time the box contains cats, who will announce their presence by meowing. Every once in a while though... 

Great for convincing your feline friend(s) that a ghost cat is roaming your home!
