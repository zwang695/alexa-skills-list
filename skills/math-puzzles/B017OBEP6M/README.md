Math Puzzles is a fun and easy way to challenge yourself and your friends. You're given a series of numbers and you must determine the next logical number in the sequence. You can ask Alexa to repeat the numbers if you need to hear them again. You can also view the numbers on the Home page of the Alexa App. If you can't figure out the puzzle, you can say "I give up" and Alexa will tell you the answer. But keep trying... you can do it!
