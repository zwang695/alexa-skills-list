To use the Animal Letters skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open animal letters*

* *start new game*

* *i don't know*

You and Alexa take turns guessing the names of animals beginning with a letter of the alphabet that Alexa randomly selects.

Alexa always takes the first guess.

Some letters have more animals than others.

You can restart an existing game by saying "Start New Game".

Alexa will tell you when it's your turn. If you don't answer, Alexa will prompt you to respond for a second time. If you still fail to answer then the game will time out.

If you can't think of an answer you can say "Don't know". If that happens Alexa will win the game but she will also suggest answers you could have given so you can learn for future games.

There are over 400 possible answers on Alexa's list.

Finally, Alexa will occasionally make a joke or provide a useful fact when you make a correct guess.

*PLEASE NOTE: If you have issues, questions, or comments please email animal.letters@gmail.com 

Enjoy!
