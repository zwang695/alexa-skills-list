To use the LightwaveRF skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, set living room main light to 75%*

* *Alexa, set the lounge to 20 degrees*

* *Alexa, turn on the kettle*

With the LightwaveRF Skill, you can now use Alexa to control LightwaveRF smart home devices, including lighting, heating and power, using voice commands. To get started, select the ‘Enable Skill’ button in the Alexa App to link your LightwaveRF account and discover your device(s).

To command LightwaveRF devices using the LightwaveRF skill, you need to specify by name which device you wish to control.  

There are two ways to define these names:

1. Use the names that you have already setup in the LightwaveRF App; these are displayed in and can be edited using the LightwaveRF App.  

2. Create a new Alexa ‘group’, such as ‘Bedroom’ or ‘Downstairs’, using the Alexa App.  You can then add new LightwaveRF devices to this group. More information is available at http://amzn.to/2965dCE.


Once you know the name of your group (e.g. bedroom sockets), you can command Alexa by saying:

“Alexa, turn on bedroom sockets”.

If you have dimmers, you can change the brightness. For example: “Alexa, brighten Downstairs to 60%", or "Alexa, dim Living room lights to 20%".
