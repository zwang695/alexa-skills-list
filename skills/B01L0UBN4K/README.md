To use the Word Chain skill, try saying...

* *Alexa play word chain*

* *start new game*

* *repeat your turn*

The word game begins by choosing a category (either countries, or US States and capitals combined with countries), and then the user determines who goes first. After the first turn is played, the next player must respond with a place that begins with the letter that the previous country or place ended with. The game continues until the user is stumped, or there are no more places beginning with the necessary letter.
