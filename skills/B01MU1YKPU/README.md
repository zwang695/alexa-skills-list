To use the Spirit Seance skill, try saying...

* *Alexa start spirit seance*

* *Who are you?*

* *What are you?*

Start a Seance! Talk to different spirits and learn about them by asking questions like "Who are you?", "What's your name" and "How did you die?" plus others. But you can only ask a couple of questions before they leave. Discover the stories of different people that may have more in common than even they think.
