To use the Ask Purina skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Purina.*

* *Alexa, ask Purina about Dachshunds.*

* *Alexa, ask Purina to find breeds that are good with children.*

Whether you’re a dog owner or enthusiast, simply Ask Purina to find the dog breed information you need to choose the perfect companion for your lifestyle.

To launch the skill, say, “Alexa, Ask Purina” and Alexa will help you discover the perfect breed for you. Get details of a specific dog breed by saying the full breed name, or search and browse dogs that match your search criteria. You can say, “Alexa, ask Purina to help me find a dog breed”, or “Alexa, ask Purina to search” to initiate a guided search.

You can search by the specific dog breed name, size, energy level, family fit, living considerations, shedding level or narrow your search by specifying hypoallergenic.

Get the inside story on different breeds by asking questions like:
“Tell me about dogs that are good with children”
“Tell me about dogs that are hypoallergenic”
“Find breeds that are good in apartments”
“Tell me about dogs that don’t shed.”

You can also filter breeds according to group, for example, “Alexa, ask Purina about toy dogs”, or “Alexa, ask Purina to tell me about terriers”. Successively add filters to narrow your search and say “Start over” if you want to start again. When you say, “Play my matches”, reference the Ask Purina companion cards on your mobile device for the results. You can say the dog breed name in full to quickly get details and images of that specific dog breed.

We’re excited to help you find the ideal dog breed for you and your loved ones. For over 80 years Purina has been passionate about the lives we share with our canine companions, and believe that pets and people are better together.
