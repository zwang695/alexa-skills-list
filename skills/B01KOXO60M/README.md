To use the Exact Measure skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Exact Measure what is 67 centimeters in inches*

* *Alexa, tell Exact Measure to Give me 73 feet in meters*

* *Alexa, ask Exact Measure for 2 feet in millimeters*

Using Exact Measure, you can specify any distance measurement in either Imperial units (feet, inches, yards, and miles) or Metric (millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers).  That distance will be converted to the equivalent measure in the specified unit to 4 significant digits.  If you ask for Imperial units, you will also receive the full measure in miles, feet, inches, and fractions of an inch.
