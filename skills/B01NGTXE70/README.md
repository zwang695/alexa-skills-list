To use the PingRing.com skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, tell PingRing I lost my phone*

* *Alexa, ask PingRing where Melissa is*

* *Alexa, ask PingRing to send Melissa a message*

Do you have an Amazon Echo, Amazon Dot, or Amazon Tap? Do you have an iPhone? Ever lose that phone? Now you can find your iPhone easily by asking the PingRing.com Alexa App where your phone is. You can also create groups of people who all have the PingRing.com App and communicate with them directly from your Alexa device or through the PingRing.com App itself.

"Alexa, tell PingRing I lost my phone."

Your Alexa device will look up the most recent location of your iPhone and tell you that address while at the same time sounding an alarm on your iPhone. Never lose your phone in the couch again.

"Alexa, tell PingRing to send a message to Brad."

"What is the message you would like to send."

"What are we going to have for dinner tonight."

Your Alexa device will then send a push notification as well as the message to Brad's iPhone. If Brad is near his Alexa device, he can send a message back or just reply within the PingRing.com App very much like replying to a text message.
