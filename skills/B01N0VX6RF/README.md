To use the Super Bowl Fan Quiz skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, begin Super Bowl Fan Quiz*

* *Alexa, start Super Bowl Fan Quiz*

* *Alexa, open Super Bowl Fan Quiz*

Short quiz about the Super Bowl Winners.  It's tougher than you might think!  Questions can be from anytime in the history of the Super Bowl.  It's multiple choice, but the answers are tricky.  The loser is also included in one of the answers!

General information is public knowledge, specifically I used www.espn.com/nfl/superbowl/history/winners as a reference.

This was fun, I'll include stats and/or player bests if I get enough interest
