To use the Lets Add skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open let's add*

* *Alexa, ask let's add to quiz me up to four plus four*

* *Alexa, ask let's add for help*

Let's Add is a skill that quizzes you on addition problems.  You can specify how high you want the questions to go, up to twenty plus twenty. 

Once you set how high you want to be quizzed on, Let's Add will ask you if you want the questions to be in order, or random. As you are learning addition you may want to start in order, then as you get better and need to be challenged, you can try random problems. 

You can say "repeat" to hear a problem again if you didn't hear it the first time.  

You can start over any time by saying "Start Over", or just say the new addition problem maximum values you want to go to, such as "five plus five". 

At any time you can say "stop" or "cancel" and you will be told the number of correct answers you gave, and the number of incorrect answers you gave, out of the total possible addition problems. 

So have fun, and learn to add.
