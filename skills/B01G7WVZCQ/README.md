Bored? Of course you are! You can only refresh your social media accounts page so much before you need a different kind of stimulation. There are 999 channels on television, but excitement ain't one. Your mobile game with matching sweets is making you wait to play again. Let's be honest, when is the last time you read a book? I think you deserve this in your life!
