To use the Habit Log skill, try saying...

* *Alexa tell Habit Log to add Workout*

* *Alexa ask Habit Log to list my habits*

* *Alexa tell Habit Log to log Workout*

Habit Log helps you create and track the things that matter most! Want to workout every day? Get up early? Make it a habit. 

Easily add new habits to Alexa and then log the habit each day. Alexa will keep track of the streak and let you know how many days in a row you've logged your habit.

Due to the way Alexa works, only approved habits can be added. Contact the dev if Alexa can't add your habit.
