To use the River Runner skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open River Runner*

* *What is the current level*

* *Alexa, ask River Runner which rivers are supported*

River Runner will tell you if your favorite whitewater river is running. Currently, this skill only works with the St. Francis river in Missouri (my home river), but it will soon be expanded to cover the most popular kayaking and canoeing rivers in North America.
