To use the Quick Events skill, try saying...

* *"Alexa, open Quick Events."*

* *"Alexa, tell Quick Events to add go for a walk tomorrow at 3:00."*

* *"Alexa, tell Quick Events to add beach trip all day Saturday."*

QuickEvents allows you to add events to your primary Google Calendar.  Quick Events can check for conflicting events,  and ask for confirmation before adding your event.

To get started say, "Alexa, launch quick events."

Quick Events is flexible. You can provide all the information about your event at once:

"Alexa, tell quick events to add go for a walk tomorrow at 9 p.m."

If you don't provide all the information Quick Events needs to schedule the event, Alexa will ask you for ask you it.

Alexa:  "What would you like to add to your calendar?"
You: "Add go for a walk"
Alexa: "For what day should I schedule the event?"
You: "For Tomorrow"
Alexa: "At what time should I schedule the event"
You: "At 9:00 p.m."

You can provide relative dates  ("tomorrow",  "next thursday") or provide a specific date ("March 25th").

By default, events are scheduled for 50 minutes, but you can specify the length of the event ("at 9:00 p.m. for three hours") or provide start and end times ("from 8:30 a.m. until 11:00 a.m.)

Quick Events supports multi-day events ("from Monday until Friday", "from January 25th until January 29th") and all day events.

Within the skill you can say "help" at any time for more information, including information on how to unlink Quick Events from your calendar
