To use the East Tides skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask east tides*

Ever have to wait for the right tide for hitting those west coast waves or just putting your boat in the water. 'East Tides' helps you know when to hit the beach. The info is from the NCAA, that is the government agency that tracks tides. Great info, but you may need to try it a couple of times. For example: "Ask East Tides get high tide for Philadelphia". Then get those toes wet.
