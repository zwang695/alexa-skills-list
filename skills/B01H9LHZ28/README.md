To use the Orbitals skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Atomic orbitals What's the electron configuration of chromium?*

* *Alexa, ask Atomic orbitals How many protons are in the nucleus of gold?*

* *Alexa, ask Atomic orbitals Tell me how the electrons are arranged in platinum*

Have you ever wanted to know how the electrons are arranged in an atom of a given element?  Orbitals will tell you the electron configuration of any atom by telling you the names of the orbitals along with how many electrons are in each one.  Orbitals will even tell you when an element's electron configuration is different from the one predicted by the Madelung rule!  If you need the total number of electrons (or protons), just ask for the atomic number.
