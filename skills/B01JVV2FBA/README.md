To use the League Champion Skill skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask League Champion what is skill of Ashe*

* *Alexa, ask League Champion Ashe*

* *Alexa, ask League Champion skill of Ashe*

This skill is for the League game. It lets you ask what are the skills of the champion you want to know.<br>
<br>
For example, you can ask Alexa for the skills of Ashe by saying:<br>
 * Alexa, ask League Champion what is skill of Ashe<br>
 * Alexa, ask League Champion what are skills of Ashe<br>
 * Alexa, ask League Champion skill of Ashe<br>
 * Alexa, ask League Champion for Ashe skill<br>
 * Alexa, ask League Champion for Ashe<br>
Then, Alexa will tell you Ashe's passive, Q, W, E, and R skill.<br>
<br>
This might help you to understand ally and enemy champ during loading. Good luck! ;)
