To use the City Services skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open city services*

* *When is the next junk set out*

* *What date is the junk pickup*

Got some junk you need to get rid of but don't know when the next junk set out will be in your area? Just ask Alexa for it and get the exact date. The junk pickup information is only available for Louisville, KY at the moment.
