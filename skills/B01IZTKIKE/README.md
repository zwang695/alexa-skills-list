Alexa, Open Dr. Quadratic
let A equal 3
let B equal 10
let C equal 2
calculate

let A equal 1
let B equal 2
let C equal -35
calculate

let A equal 1
let B equal 3.5
let C equal 7
calculate

Notes:

To skip the skill intro you can say...
Open Dr. Quadratic and let B equal 5

At startup the default coefficients are A=1, B=0, C=0, so you can say....

Open Dr. Quadratic and calculate, which will solve the default equation
x² = 0.
