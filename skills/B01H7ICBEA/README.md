To use the Date Night skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Date Night to give us a brunch suggestion in Chicago*

* *suggest a free activity in Chicago*

* *where should we go for dinner in Chicago*

This skill gives you a random, crowdsourced suggestion for an idea for a local activity or restaurant that can be used for a date with your significant other.  You can ask for dinner or brunch spots, or even indoor and free activities, and Alexa will give you a random suggestion complete with address and other additional information you might need to know.  Additional cities, restaurants, and activities, or modifications to existing ones, can be added by contributing to the open source project located at https://github.com/irlrobot/alexa_date_night.  This skill may not be suitable for all ages.
