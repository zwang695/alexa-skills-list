To use the Multiples skill, try saying...

* *Alexa open multiples*

* *the answer is 42*

* *new game on level 3*

Multiples will ask you 5 random multiplication questions from 1x1 to 100x100 depending on your level and checks the answer. It is a great way to either learn the times tables, or test your skills. Also a good brain exercise. If your basic tables is too easy, just tell multiples what level you want.

Level one is 1x1 to 12x12. Level 2 is 1x1 to 20x20, Level 3 is 1x1 to 30x30, and so on until level 10 which is 1x1 to 100x100.
