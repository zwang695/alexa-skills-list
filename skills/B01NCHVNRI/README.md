To use the DG Racing skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask d. g. racing what races went on last weekend*

* *Alexa, ask d. g. racing what races went on October twenty ninth of this year*

If you have attended any race of DG Racing's, this is your all informative race assistant. We've started with giving you the line up of races each weekend and their winners and it will just get better from there. We'll soon be adding the ability to get your own personal results as well as future events and even the ability to get your individual result emailed straight to you by your request.
