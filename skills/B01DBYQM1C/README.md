Let Alexa curate your next party with a series of drinking games. Currently includes "Circle Of Death", "Never Have I Ever" and "Most Likely"

To start simply say "Alexa Start DrinkMaster" and you will walked through the rest.

Circle Of Death - Circle of death is a drinking game that closely resembles Kings, where players ask Alexa to draw one card per turn and perform actions based on the card drawn.

Never Have I Ever - Never have I ever is a game where Alexa will say things she has never done.  Anyone who has done it must take a drink.

Most Likely - Most Likely is a game where Alexa will state a topic.  Players then choose someone at the party who qualifies best.  That person drinks.
