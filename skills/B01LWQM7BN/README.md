To use the Coach Harbaugh skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Coach Harbaugh for a quote*

* *Alexa, ask Coach Harbaugh to play The Victors*

* *Alexa, ask Coach Harbaugh WHO'S GOT IT BETTER THAN US!?*

Need to get fired up? Of course you don't - you are already attacking today with an enthusiasm unknown to mankind. But how about having your own personal Jim Harbaugh to entertain you on game day? Or on Mondays. Or every single morning while you wash down your steak breakfast with whole milk. 

You can say:
1. Alexa, ask Coach Harbaugh for a quote
2. Alexa, ask Coach Harbaugh to play "The Victors"
3. Alexa, ask Coach Harbaugh WHO'S GOT IT BETTER THAN US!?

Please note that this skill is not affiliated with the University of Michigan in any way. I'm just a fan with the constitutional right to share Jim Harbaugh's wisdom with you.

Special thanks to Sibish Basheer for making this possible.
