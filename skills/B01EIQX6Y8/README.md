To use the TP-LINK Kasa skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, turn on Christmas Tree Light*

* *Alexa, turn on my Bedroom lights*

* *Alexa, brighten Downstairs to 60 percent*

With the TP-LINK Kasa skill and Alexa, you can now interact with your TP-LINK Kasa lights and switches by voice. To get started, select the ‘Enable Skill’ button in the Alexa App to link your TP-LINK Kasa account and discover your device(s). Find more information about connecting Smart Home devices at http://amzn.to/291lR7u.

When using the skill, you need to specify by name which device to use. There are two ways to define this/these name(s):
* Use the name(s) you set up already – these are shown in the TP-LINK Kasa app and can be changed, or
* Create an Alexa group, like Bedroom or Downstairs, and add the device to the group. More information is available at http://amzn.to/2965dCE.

Once you know the name or group of your device(s), you can say the following: 
* If you have switches or non-dimmable lights, you can turn them on/off, for example: “Alexa, turn on my Bedroom lights”.
* If you have dimmable lights, you can change the brightness, for example: “Alexa, brighten Downstairs to 60 percent", or "Alexa, dim the Living Room lights".
