To use the Lyrical skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open Lyrical.*

* *Alexa, ask Lyrical what song goes we will rock you.*

* *Alexa, ask Lyrical what song has the lyrics we will rock you.*

Lyrical helps you remember songs that you do not know the name to but you remember some of the lyrics. The lyrics provided to Lyrical should try to be unique to the song, however, if you only know certain phrases you can limit the results by providing Alexa with an artist name. 

To get started say, "Alexa, open Lyrical".

Lyrical can also be provided with the lyrics in numerous ways such as: 
"Alexa, ask Lyrical what song has the lyrics 'we will rock you'"
"Alexa, ask Lyrical what song goes 'we will rock you'"
"Alexa, ask Lyrical what has 'we will rock you' in it"
"Alexa, ask Lyrical what's the song with 'we will rock you'"
"Alexa, ask Lyrical what the lyrics 'we will rock you' are from"
"Alexa, ask Lyrical what the song with 'we will rock you' is"

You can also give lyrical commands like:
"Alexa, ask Lyrical to  tell me the song that has 'we will rock you'"
"Alexa, ask Lyrical for the song with 'we will rock you'"
"Alexa, ask Lyrical for 'we will rock you'"

The dialog will continue like:
Alexa: "Do you know the artist's name?"
You: "Yes"
Alexa: "What is the artist's name?"
You: "Queen"
Alexa: "Are you thinking of We will rock you by Queen?"
You: "Yes"
Alexa: "I am glad I could help you, talk to me soon."

If Alexa is incorrect in the song name this dialog will follow:
Alexa: "Are you thinking of Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen?"
You: "No"
Alexa: "Are you thinking of We are the Champions by Queen?"
You: "No"
Alexa: "Are you thinking of We will rock you by Queen?"
You: "Yes"
Alexa: "I am glad I could help you, talk to me soon."

Within the skill you can say "help" at any time for more information on how to use the skill.
