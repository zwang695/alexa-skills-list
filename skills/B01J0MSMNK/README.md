To use the Nag My Kids skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, tell those kids to brush their teeth*

* *Alexa, tell those kids to make their beds*

* *Alexa, tell those kids to get dressed*

If your kids are anything like mine, then you're probably pretty tired of telling them to do the same things over and over again. Fortunately, now Alexa can nag your kids to do the things they should be doing.

For example, to get your kids ready for bed say:
"Alexa, tell those kids to brush their teeth" and Alexa will forward the message to them in a way that they'll understand.
