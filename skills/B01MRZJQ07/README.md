To use the Who Goes First? skill, try saying...

* *Alexa Open Who Goes First*

* *Alexa Ask Who Goes First Out of 5 players*

* *Alexa Tell Who Goes First We have 4 players*

You know when you're sitting around the table on game night and someone asks "so, who goes first?" Queue the arguments over who went first last time, the debates over what "random" method to use, and the suggestions of starting player "mini-games" with wacky decision criteria. Skip the fuss and simply say "Alexa, ask who goes first?" It's simple, fast, unbiased, and definitive. You'll be playing in seconds.
