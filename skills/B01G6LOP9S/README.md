To use the Motivate Me - By SexyHackers.com skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, motivate me*

* *Alexa, tell motivate me to give me a quote*

* *Alexa, ask motivate me for an inspiring quote*

Just say 'Alexa, motivate me,' and she will randomly read a motivational quote from our database.  If Alexa can locate the actual audio snippet of the author of the quote on YouTube, she will even play the original sound bite for you instead of reading it.  

Designed for entrepreneurs, software developers, business professionals, or people who need a little inspiration to start their day.  So get motivated and make today the day your dreams come true!  

We have also designed a t-shirt, poster, and canvas for every inspirational quote you hear which you can purchase on our website http://sexyhackers.com to support the development of this skill.   You can view a preview of the t-shirt design or poster containing the quote she just read in the Alexa Companion App.  

DISCLAIMER :  SexyHackers.com does NOT contain any nudity and is work safe.  It's just a fun website which sells t-shirts, posters, and hats containing motivational quotes.   However, some of these famous quotes may not be suitable for all ages as they may contain adult language.  We feature quotes from business leaders like Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Steve Jobs, Aaron Levie,  Haward Schutz, Blake Mycoskie, Dennis Crowley, Mark Zuckerberg and much more! 

WANT US TO ADD A QUOTE: 
If there is a particular quote you would like us to add send us the information on Twitter @MoreThanRewards and we'll do our best to add it!

HAVING TROUBLE WITH THIS SKILL: The only item we're aware of is if you have more than one echo device, you might need to disable and re-enable the skill again if you add a new echo to your account. This is normal since everything has to resync to the new devices.  So if you're having trouble just disable and re-enable the skill then try again by saying 'Alexa, Motivate Me', all will be good.   

The other obvious item is some folks have changed their device name to Amazon or Echo, as a reminder, if you do that then you'll need to say 'Amazon Motivate Me' or 'Echo Motivate Me' depending on what you call your echo.   We had one person who didn't realize this and claim the skill didn't work on our review but the problem was they didn't invoke it with the correct echo name.  So before you post a review if you could give us a chance to help you we would love to help you since we have no way to actually contact people who write reviews if they don't contact us. 

You can call our customer support line at 414-326-4100 or email support@morethanrewards.com or do live chat with u s on our website SexyHackers.com, we're open Monday to Friday 8AM to 5PM Central Time. 

We want to make Alexa awesome so if you have any ideas on how to improve this skill just let us know. 

THANK YOU!
