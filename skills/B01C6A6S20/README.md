To use the Code Phrase Generator skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask for a code phrase.*

Generate a code phrase for your next top secret project! Previously the domain of the NSA and the CIA, now you too can give obscure and whimsical phrases to your:

- latest top secret project critical to national security,
- an obscure software component you need a funny but clever name for,
- naming your next newborn (j/k, please don't do this).

For now you simply have to say "Alexa, ask for a code phrase" and a random two-word code phrase will be yours! The phrase will either be a "<noun> <noun>" or "<adjective> <noun>", where each word is not too short and not too long and doesn't have too many syllables.

I'm open to feature requests! If you think alternative patterns like "<color> <animal>" or "<temperature> <material>" sounds awesome, let me know!
