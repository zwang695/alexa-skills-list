To use the Bay Area Transit for Caltrain skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Bay Area Transit for the next 3 trains from San Francisco to Palo Alto.*

* *Alexa, ask Bay Area Transit for the next BART from Civic Centre to Millbrae 20 minutes from now.*

* *Alexa, ask Bay Area Transit in 35 minutes from West Oakland to SFO.*

Alexa knows when Caltrain and BART are leaving next. Ask for multiple trains at once or for trains leaving some time in the future.

This skill gives you the next leaving train, the next few trains in case you don't know which one you will make or one or multiple trains in the future - we all have to get to the station first, don't we?
