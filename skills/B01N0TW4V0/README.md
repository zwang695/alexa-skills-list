To use the Inbound Asteroid skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, tell Inbound Asteroid to find meteors for tomorrow*

* *Alexa, ask Inbound Asteroid what's nearby*

* *Alexa, ask Inbound Asteroid to find comets for June 21st, 2016*

The Inbound Asteroid skill finds the nearest comet, asteroid, meteor, or other body to your location when given a date. Ask for yesterday's comet, tomorrow's meteor, or the nearest asteroid as of a specific date!  Plus, be warned if any of the objects nearest your location are considered hazardous.

You can also find out about asteroids in the future and past! Say "Alexa, ask Inbound Asteroid what's coming on Tuesday" or "Alexa, tell Inbound Asteroid to find meteors on Friday".

Uses the NASA NEO API for source data.
