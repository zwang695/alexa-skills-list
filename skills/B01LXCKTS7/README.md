"Alexa, play Juke Box"

Juke Box lets you play 10-second sounds recorded by the community of Amazon Echo users.

After each sound is played, you can say "Like" to bring the sound into the popular feed or say "Next" to hear the next sound. 

To add new sounds to Juke Box download the iOS app.
Search for "Jukebox Alexa" in the Appstore or visit this link with your iOS device: http://bit.ly/jukeboxalexa

You can record jokes, musics, famous quotes, thoughts and whatever you want. It's like audio gif for smart speakers.

As soon as you upload a new sound, wait one minute and say "Alexa, ask Juke Box what's new" to hear your sound.
