To use the Star Date Converter skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Star Date Converter to get today's star date*

* *What is the Star Date for April 5th, 2161*

* *Find the Star Date for tomorrow*

Look up of the standardized United Federation of Planets Star Date equivalent to the traditional Earth date in accordance with the formatting used in the recent  "alternate" Star Trek movies. Just say look up the Star Date for February 2nd, 2161 or you can say what is the Star Date for today, yesterday, tomorrow, X days or years from today.

Date ranges from the 10th thru 30th Centuries are valid input or you can extend the range to Earth year 0 through 9999 by saying X years from today.

Space exploration trivia for significant historical and future Star Dates is also provided.
