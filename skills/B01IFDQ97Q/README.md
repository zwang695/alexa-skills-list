With the skill and Alexa, you can now interact with your Bryant® Housewise™ thermostats by voice to control your home comfort.

To get started, select the ‘Enable Skill’ button in the Alexa App to link your Housewise account and discover your thermostat(s). Find more information about connecting Smart Home devices at http://amzn.to/291lR7u
When using the skill, you need to specify by name which thermostat to use. There are two ways to define this/these names:
• Use the thermostat name(s) you set up already – these are shown in the Housewise app and can be changed on the thermostat (go to Settings > Preferences > Thermostat > Input the new name)
Or
• Create an Alexa group, like Bedroom or Downstairs, and add the thermostat and/or one or more sensors to the group. More information can be found at http://amzn.to/2965dCE

Once you know the name or group of your thermostat, you can say the following: “Alexa, lower Bedroom by three degrees”, or “Alexa, set Downstairs temperature to 72.”
