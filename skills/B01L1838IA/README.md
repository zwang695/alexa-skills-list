To use the My Government skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask My Government who represents me*

* *Alexa, ask My Government who is the senator from Wyoming*

* *Alexa, tell  My Government  to describe New York district twelve*

Find out who represents you in government, even if you don't know what district you live in!


Using "My Government" is easy:

Alexa, ask My Government who represents me

My government will ask you where you live, and tell you your Senators and one or more Congrssional Representatives whose districts are in your zip code.


Other examples are:
Who is my congressman?
Who are my senators?



If you don't want to supply your zip code, or you want to look up a different area, you can ask questions like:


Who is the at large representative from North Dakota?

Who represents  district two in New York?

Who are the senators from Oklahoma?



My Government uses data from the Sunlight Foundation (http://sunlightfoundation.com/)


Helpful Hints:
-- The At-Large district is district zero
-- Say "district ten" instead of "the tenth district"
-- Some PO Box, APO, and MPO zip codes cannot be recognized yet
-- The District of Columbia and some US territories have representatives in the House, but not in the Senate
-- Some districts are not currently represented in Congress due to the death or resignation of a member
