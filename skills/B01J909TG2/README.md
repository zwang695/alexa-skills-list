Add Alexa to your Control4 Smart Home for added convenience of whole-home automation through voice control. Simple and intuitive voice commands activate smart home scenes and allow you to control individual or groups of devices.

The Control4 Smart Home Skill supports the full set of Alexa voice commands for controlling lights, thermostats, and fully-orchestrated scenes. Simply say “Alexa, turn on bedtime” to activate the scene that you have set up for your nighty ritual, “Alexa, turn on kitchen cooking” to set the perfect lighting while you prepare dinner, or even adjust a thermostat quickly and easily by saying “Alexa, set the upstairs temperature to 72 degrees”. When naming scenes, use the room name in cases where it is appropriate. For example: Alexa, turn on office lamps.

Get started by adding the Control4 Smart Home Skill, authenticating with Control4, and then simply discover your devices. Visit customer.control4.com to rename devices and scenes to your liking, select which devices and scenes are exposed to your Alexa device, and view a list of voice commands you can use with your system. You can also use the Alexa App to create groups of devices like Bedroom or Downstairs by adding a number of devices to those groups.

With assistance from your Control4 dealer, you can take voice control of your home a step further with comprehensive scenes. For example, in addition to the lights and temperature, you can add control of shades, audio, video, and so much more into the scenes of your choice. For instance, say “Alexa, turn on away” and every light in the house turns off and all audio/video devices shut down.

The Control4 Smart Home Skill requires an active Control4 4Sight subscription. For more information, visit ctrl4.co/alexa-help.
