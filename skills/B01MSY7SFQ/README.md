To use the Quote Box skill, try saying...

* *Alexa open quote box and give me a quote*

* *Alexa ask quote box to tell me a verse*

* *Alexa open quote box*

Many skills give you only quotes, and some skills give you only verses. This skill can provide either a quote or a verse.

Just say "Alexa, open Quote Box", then say "Give me a quote". Alexa would pick and speak a quote. 

If you are interested in a Bible verse, say "Alex, open Quote Box and tell me a verse".

After speaking the quote or verse, Alexa would say "Ready".

If you didn't hear Alexa clearly, you can say "Repeat".

If you want to find out who wrote it, you can ask "who is the author", or simply "author".

If you're on Fire TV, you can also see the author of the quote.

On Echo boxes, you can ask Alexa to repeat the quote or the verse, or ask for the author.
