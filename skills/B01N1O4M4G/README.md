To use the Blog Helper skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Blog Helper for my notifications.*

* *Start a new post titled "My vacation in Spain."*

* *Do I have any comments to moderate?*

This skill allows you to check your WordPress.com notifications, moderate pending comments, and save blog post ideas as drafts -- no typing required.

To check your notifications, just ask: "Alexa, open Blog Helper and check my notifications." Alexa will read the new ones to you one-by-one, marking each one as read as you listen to it.

You can create draft blog posts with Alexa too. Say, "Alexa, tell Blog Helper to create a new post called 'My thoughts on gardening.'"  This skill will save the post as a draft so you can expound on your ideas later.

Comment moderation has never been easier (or more vocal). "Alexa, ask Blog Helper if I have any new comments," and you'll be able to approve, delete, or mark them as spam.
