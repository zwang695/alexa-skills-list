To use the Starfish Me skill, try saying...

* *Alexa open starfish me*

* *Alexa ask starfish me to tell me when is my wifes birthday*

* *Alexa  ask starfish me for what is my daughter's name*

Its a simple skill started for my friend to give him something he can use to customize alexa without much technical knowledge. You can use the skill to say name in houses like impressing your kids by making alexa responding to what is my daughter or son name. To use the skill you first need to register at www.starfishmint.com/me2 and then link your account when you activate the skill. Next step is to add some phrases you will like alexa to respond to on the website. You can use the skill as your digital diary to remind you of things. You can only add 5 word questions on the site and make sure you phrase the question exactly the same as on website when asking alexa
