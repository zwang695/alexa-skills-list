* *Alexa, get today's reading from the Pearl of Great Price*

* *Alexa, ask the Pearl of Great Price for today's reading*

This skill lets Alexa read a daily scheduled passage from the Pearl of Great Price.

Since the Pearl of Great Price is so short, we read it twice during the year: from January 1st to June 30th and then start over for July 1st to December 31st. Join in with us!

Ask Alexa every day to hear that day's reading. If you miss a day, no problem! Just ask Alexa to read the missed reading by saying:
Alexa, get the reading for yesterday from the Pearl of Great Price
-or-
Alexa, ask the Pearl of Great Price to get the reading from December 1st, 2016.
