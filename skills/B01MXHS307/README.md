PoffinDex helps trainers keep track of which berries support growth in certain contest stats.  You can request which berries influence a certain contest stat by asking which berries are for beauty, smartness, toughness, cuteness, or coolness.  You can also request which berries will help you attain a certain poffin flavor by asking for either sour, bitter, sweet, spicy, or dry berries.
