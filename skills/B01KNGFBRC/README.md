* *Alexa, open pizza toppings*

* *What topping should I put on my pizza*

* *pizza topping*

Not sure what kind of topping to put on your pizza. That's ok. Alexa will help you out. When you are unsure what you should put on your pizza, allow Alexa to decide for you. Maybe she will recommend pepperoni, mushrooms, cheese, or another great pizza topping.
