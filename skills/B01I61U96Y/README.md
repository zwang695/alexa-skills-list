To use the Creative Block skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, start Creative Block*

* *Alexa, ask creative block to tell me some advice*

* *Alexa, open creative block*

Creative Block is a tool that helps you overcome stalls in ideation and execution by delivering lateral thinking to gain perspective.
 
This skill surfaces a statement, strategy, truism or concept to help you overcome creative block, with respectful deference to the work and ideas of Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt. While seemingly unrelated to whatever the task at hand, the statements can provide a spark, detour or new frame of reference to reignite your process, be it ideation, development, refinement or execution.
