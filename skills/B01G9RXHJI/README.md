To become a naturalized U.S. citizen, one must pass the naturalization test. At your naturalization interview, there will be questions about U.S History and government. This civics test is an oral test and the USCIS Officer will ask the applicant up to 10 questions. An applicant must answer 6 out of 10 questions correctly to pass the civics portion of the naturalization test. Take this sample civics test to practice for the real interview. The actual civics test is NOT a multiple choice test. The instructions and content in this practice civics test are not intended to provide legal advice or guarantee that you will pass the civics test during your naturalization interview.
