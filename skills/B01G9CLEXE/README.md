To use the Farmers Market skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Farmer's Market what's in season in New York?*

* *What vegetables are in season in Florida this Summer?*

* *Are strawberries in season in California in June?*

Ever wonder if the fruits and vegetables in your store or farmers market are in
season? Now you can find out quickly by asking the Farmers Market app!

Request all foods in season for the current or any specific month or season
(Spring, Summer, etc). If desired, narrow results to an individual state.
