To use the Meat Thermometer skill, try saying...

* *Alexa Open Meat Thermometer*

* *Alexa, ask Meat Thermometer the temperature for pork*

* *Alexa, ask Meat Thermometer how I should cook chicken*

Now with Meat Thermometer for Alexa, you don't need to look up the internal cooking temperature of the most common kinds of meat. You don't have to wash your hands to grab the cookbook, when you can ask alexa for the cooking temperature of steak (rare, medium rare, medium, medium well, and well done), chicken, ham, turkey, and pork. Temperatures are given in Fahrenheit and Celsius.
