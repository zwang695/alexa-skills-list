I'm Barry Thain. I'm a Clinical Hypnotist with more than 20 years of experience in private practice, including eight years with the National Health Service.  I have treated thousands of people from all over the world, for a wide range of physiological and psychological issues, from Acne to Zenophobia and all points in between.
 
Therapeutic hypnotism is been done face to face when your specific circumstances can be accommodated. Skype sessions (Skypnosis) can also be very effective. I have recorded some hypnotherapy protocols that you can experience with this Alexa App in your home, for when personal therapy isnâ€™t possible.
