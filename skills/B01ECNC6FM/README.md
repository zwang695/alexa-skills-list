To use the Chef skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Chef what I can use instead of two tablespoons of baking powder*

* *how much do three cups of bread flour weigh*

* *what's a good substitute for cooking wine*

Do you ever find that you are missing an ingredient when following a recipe? Chef can help! Ask what can be substituted. Some ingredients have multiple options. You can also ask Chef how much certain ingredients weigh, which is especially helpful for baking, or any kind of cooking where reproducibility is important.

Not every ingredient that Chef knows has a substitute and a weight. Some ingredients only have one or the other.

Chef will improve over time with cooking tips, new ingredients, and so on.
