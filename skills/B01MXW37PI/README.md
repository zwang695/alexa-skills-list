There are 24 character strengths that are universal to every single one of us on the planet. Yet, it is the combination of these strengths that shapes our unique character. You might be naturally stronger in some strengths, and your family or friends might be stronger in others. For example, you might be naturally creative; have a child who’s highly caring; a friend with amazing self-control; and a partner with lots of courage.
