With the Honeywell skill and Alexa, you can now interact with your Honeywell Lyric thermostat(s) with your voice.  
This skill is compatible with Lyric Round™ Wi-Fi, Lyric T5, and Lyric T6 Pro Thermostats.

To get started, select the ‘Enable Skill’ button in the Alexa App to link your Honeywell Lyric account and discover your thermostat(s). Find more information about connecting Smart Home devices at http://amzn.to/291lR7u

When using the skill, you need to specify by name which thermostat/sensor to use. There are two ways to define this/these names:
- Use the name(s) you set up already – these are shown and can be changed in the Lyric app, or
- Create an Alexa group, like Bedroom or Downstairs, and add the thermostat and/or one or more sensors to the group. More information at http://amzn.to/2965dCE

Once you know the name or group of your thermostat, you can say the following: “Alexa, lower Bedroom by 3 degrees”, or “Alexa, set Downstairs temperature to 72”.
The full list of commands includes:
- “Alexa, set [group or thermostat name] to X degrees”
- “Alexa, raise [group or thermostat name] by X degrees”
- “Alexa, lower [group or thermostat name] by X degrees”
