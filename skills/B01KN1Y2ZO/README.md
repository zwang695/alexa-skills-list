By connecting Iris and Alexa, you're about to experience a whole new way to interact with your connected home. Use the Iris Smart Home Skill to set thermostats and adjust lights & switches.<br/> 
<br/>
Thermostats:
<br/>"Alexa, set Downstairs Thermostat to 70 degrees."
<br/>"Alexa, increase Upstairs Thermostat by 2 degrees."<br/>
<br/>
Lights & Switches:
<br/>"Alexa, turn off Kitchen Light."
<br/>"Alexa, dim Living Room Light by 60 percent."
<br/>"Alexa, brighten Bedroom Lamp."<br/>
<br/>
What's in a Name?<br/>
Give your Iris devices names that will be natural to speak.  For Example:  "Alexa, turn on the Living Room Lamp", Not "Alexa, turn on the RGB 19 Light Bulb."<br/>
<br/>
You Speak, Alexa Listens<br/>
Alexa takes commands from any voice. To avoid unintended interactions, consider muting the speaker during parties, or when leaving the house.<br/>
<br/>
*To add the Iris – Optimized for Smart Home Skill, you must have an Iris account. Create an account by downloading the Iris by Lowe’s mobile app. In many cases, the Iris Smart Hub will be required. Once you have paired your devices to Iris, select the "Enable Skill" button in the Alexa app.
