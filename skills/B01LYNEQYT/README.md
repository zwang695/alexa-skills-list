To use the Resistor Assistant skill, try saying...

* *Alexa ask resistor assist brown black red.*

* *calculate two hundred and three hundred in parallel.*

* *what is the series resistance of one thousand and three thousand?*

This is a simple app that assists you with decoding the three color bands on resistors as well as calculating the effective resistance of two resistors in parallel or series.  It is possible to use the decoded resistor as one of the resistances in the series or parallel calculation.  If you do not provide enough information for calculating an effective resistance, resutil will prompt you for the missing information.
