To use the Zodiac skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Zodiac the sign of someone born on October fifth*

* *Alexa, ask Zodiac what sign is someone born in May*

* *Alexa, ask Zodiac the sign for June twentieth*

Zodiac tells you the sign for any date. It's hard to remember which dates each sign corresponds to. Now you can quickly find out by asking Alexa. It's really simple - just ask Zodiac for the sign for a specific day, like March 15th, or a month.
