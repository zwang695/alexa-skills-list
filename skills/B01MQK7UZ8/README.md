To use the Air Traffic Control skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open air traffic control*

* *Are there any aircraft near New York*

* *How many helicopters are over San Francisco*

Air Traffic Control uses live radar data to give information about aircraft flying within a 20-kilometer radius of a location. Depending on the information available, you will get information about the aircraft's manufacturer, model, current altitude above the ground, and who is operating it.

Tip: If your location doesn't have any aircraft flying overhead, try asking about somewhere else with a busy airport, such as New York City.
