* *Alexa, ask Little Rover to create folders*

* *Alexa, ask Little Rover to fetch christmas*

* *Alexa, ask Little Rover to fetch metro using seven hundred four*

Sometimes you just want to test out a new API without the bother of creating a new skill in the developer console.  Or maybe you're new to Alexa coding and just want to test the waters to see if your skill idea will fly.  Well with Rover you get the best of both worlds.  Simply write your API calls and use Rover to communicate with Alexa.  Example "bones" or code files are included to get you started.  PLEASE NOTE: due to technical issues you will need to use your web browser to enable the Rover skill (http://alexa.amazon.com/).
