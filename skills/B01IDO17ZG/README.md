To use the My Bookmarks skill, try saying...

* *alexa start my bookmarks*

* *add book cryptonomicon*

* *book little brother on page one hundred*

We all love the Kindle but still have a few physical books around. Get Alexa to keep track of your bookmarks with My Bookmarks!
You can add books and you can update your bookmarks as many times as you need. You can keep multiple books at the same time.

Even though the Skill can recognize any book title, Alexa sometimes struggles with complicated ones. You can help her by always saying book before you say the title. To make things even easier for her, we've made sure she knows the complete bibliography by Cory Doctorow, Neal Stephenson and Kim Stanley Robinson perfectly well. 

Please contact us with your favorite authors and we'll include their works in subsequent versions of the Skill.
