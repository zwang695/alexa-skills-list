To use the Nordic Runes skill, try saying...

* *Alexa ask Nordic Runes for a rune*

* *Alexa  ask Nordic Runes about runes*

* *Alexa ask Nordic Runes to say a Nordic Rune*

Runes derive from sounds believed to be associated with power. These sounds were encoded as symbols and they too appeared to tap into something powerful. The symbols appear carved on graves and in rock.  Runes can be invoked to answer questions, and assist in decision making.  This application lists the 24 runs of the Younger Futhark - the 24 runes of power. Maybe. What's to lose.
