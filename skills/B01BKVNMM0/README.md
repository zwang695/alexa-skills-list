Then movie info asks if you want details (description, actors, directors) for each movie in turn.   Errors searching theMovieDB result in "I had a problem with" <title>..  You can ask for help or say "repeat".  Or you can say "new movie" to restart searching another title.  You can say stop or goodbye to end the skill.
