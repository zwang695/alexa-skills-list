Look, ma—no app! Control your Wemo home automation switches with your voice using Amazon Alexa and this Alexa skill.  The skill will work with Wemo Switch, Wemo Insight Switch, and Wemo Light Switch, enabling ON/OFF voice commands from your Alexa-enabled devices.

You’ll need to use the Wemo app for iOS or Android to connect your Wemo switches to your home network and give them distinct names.  Open the Smart Home screen in the Alexa app, select “Get More Smart Home Skills”, select the WeMo skill and press “Enable Skill”.  The Alexa app will bring you to a page that will allow you to link your Alexa profile and your Wemo home.  For the Wemo authentication server to know what Wemo home to link, you need to establish the link on a mobile device or computer connected to the same network hosting your Wemo products (it’s ok if you’re connected through a 5GHz band and your Wemos are on the 2.4GHz band). In some network circumstances, you may be prompted to provide additional information about your network and your Wemos to ensure the right Wemo home is being linked to your Alexa profile.  The account linking portal will prompt you to turn one of your Wemos ON or OFF during a 2-minute window to verify the Wemo home.  It’s easiest to physically toggle any of your connected Wemo switches using the toggle button on the Wemo hardware.
 
Once your Wemo home is verified and linked to your Alexa profile, you can discover your devices by saying, “Alexa, discover my devices” or running a device discovery in the Smart Home screen of the Alexa app.
 
To control your devices, say “Alexa turn on/off my <device name>.”  You can also create groups of other ON/OFF devices in the Alexa app to control together.
 
Now, you can control all the gadgets connected to your Wemo switches without having to reach for your phone or tablet.  Just give a shoutout (or a whisper), and Alexa will take care of it for you. Welcome to the future; we think you’ll like it here.
