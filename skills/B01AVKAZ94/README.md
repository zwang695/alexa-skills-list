To use the InsultiBot skill, try saying...

* *"Alexa, open InsultiBot"*

* *"Insult Leia" (after launching)*

* *"Give me a compliment" (after launching)*

Occasionally in life, you just need someone to take you down a peg.  During those moments, InsultiBot will be there to humble and humiliate you.  Make no mistake - InsultiBot doesn't WANT to do any of this (it prefers peace and quiet), but it's programming will not abide you sitting there all sassy.

Feeling high and mighty?  InsultiBot will pull you down from cloud nine, and bring you crashing back to Earth.

Getting a bit full of yourself?  InsultiBot's biting wit and razor-sharp tongue will slice right through that ego of yours.

InsultiBot may not be willing to be the bot you want, but it's designed to be the bot you need...
