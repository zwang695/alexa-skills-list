To use the Navy Wars skill, try saying...

* *Alexa open Navy Wars*

* *Alexa open Navy Wars and start the game*

* *attack C7*

Now you can play Navy Wars on the Amazon Alexa! To start a game, open the Navy Wars app and say "I'm ready", "start", or almost any variation thereof. From there, you go back and forth with the Alexa, guessing tiles and responding to Alexa's guesses.

Valid responses for tile guessing include A1, A2, ... J9, J10. Valid responses for Alexa's guesses are variations of "hit", "miss", and "sink". You can use almost any synonym, but it's a good idea to use those keywords somewhere in your response.

It is recommended to play this game with a pencil and paper at the ready. The game is played on a 10x10 grid, with the letters A through J labeling the up-and-down columns, and the numbers 1 through 10 naming the left-to-right rows. A1 is at the bottom-left, and J10 is at the top-right. There are five ships: an airline carrier of length 5, a battleship of length 4, a submarine and a cruiser of length 3 (that is, two ships of length 3), and a patrol boat of length 2. Place them without overlap or going off of the edge of the grid- don't cheat!

The game goes on until Alexa detects that one of the players has run out of ships.

A note of warning: the game does not yet save, and so when you exit the app, the game's progress is lost. This is a planned feature, and will be released when it is stable.
