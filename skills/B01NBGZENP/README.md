To use the Read the Old Testament This Year skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open the Old Testament*

* *Alexa, get today's reading from the Old Testament*

* *Alexa, ask the Old Testament for today's reading*

This skill lets Alexa read a daily scheduled passage from the King James Version of the Old Testament, with the goal to finish by the end of the year.

We start on January 1st every year and end on December 31st, so join in with us!

Ask Alexa every day to hear that day's reading. If you miss a day, no problem! Just ask Alexa to read the missed reading by saying:
Alexa, get the reading for yesterday from the Old Testament
-or-
Alexa, ask the Old Testament to get the reading from December 1st, 2016.

Other ways to phrase your interaction:

-- Listen to today's verses --
Alexa, ask the Old Testament to read today's scriptures.
Alexa, ask Old Testament to read.
Alexa, read from the Old Testament.
Alexa, ask the Old Testament for todayâ€™s reading.

-- Read the scriptures for another date --
Alexa, ask the Old Testament to read me the scriptures for tomorrow.
