Focused Inbox:

Notion's intelligence layer on your email automatically focuses on the messages most important to you. Now you can use Alexa effectively to stay on top of your inbox without being overwhelmed. As you go through your important message list, you can "Read", "Respond", "Archive", "Delete", and even "Snooze" each message.

Waiting Questions:

You can even ask Alexa "what is waiting." Notion detects messages you need to respond to and conveniently pulls out questions in them for you. Just ask Notion to "Respond [with your message]" to get them off your list.

Clean your Inbox:

If you've got some extra hands-free time on your hands (pealing potatoes tonight?), ask Notion to "clean your inbox." Notion will cycle through your list of less important emails so you can "Read", "Archive" or "Delete" them.

Get the Whole Story:

If you need a little more information about a sender, ask Notion "who introduced us?" Notion will reveal how you met the sender from your email's perspective. How cool is that?

When you are curious about how your network is growing, try asking Notion "who have I recently met?" Notion will tell you about your most recent new connections and provide details about them.

Add some Security:

Are you worried who might walk up and ask Alexa about your email? Add a security pin. Just ask Notion to "Lock my inbox" and enter a pin until your ready to use the skill again.
