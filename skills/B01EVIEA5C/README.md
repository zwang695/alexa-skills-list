To use the Date Ninja skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Date Ninja what day of the week is December 25, 2016?*

* *What is the date 45 days from now?*

* *What is the date 10 weeks from today?*

Ever want to know the date 45 days from now? Or 8 weeks from now? Or what day of the week a date falls on? Or how many days since or until a date? These are questions Date Ninja can help you with.
