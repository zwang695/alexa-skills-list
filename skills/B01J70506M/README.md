To use the Daily Food skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Daily Food for Saturday*

* *Alexa, get food for today from Daily Food*

* *Alexa, open Daily Food and get food for tomorrow.*

Given a date (today, Saturday, July 1st, etc...), the Daily Food skill will tell you which food and/or drinks are celebrated on that day.   Great conversation starters, and this skill may even help you decide what to cook for dinner each week!
