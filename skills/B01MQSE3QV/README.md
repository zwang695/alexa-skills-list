To use the Woody or Tinny skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask woody or tinny for a word*

* *That is a tinny word*

* *I think that is a woody sort of word*

Think you know if a word is woody or tinny? Best prove it, Becky old chap!

Let Alexa know if a word is woody or tinny sounding and see how you compare to other Alexa users.  What better way to spend an afternoon, other than playing with Aunt Lavinia's croquet hoops or taking a bath, I suppose.

For example:
'newspaper' - dreadful *tinny* sort of word

(This skill is based off of Monty Python's "Woody and Tinny Words" sketch)
