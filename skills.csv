"1-Minute Mindfulness",,"GeekGirl Marketing and App Development","**********************************************\nDear Customers, Due to an issue on August 19th, the 1-Minute Mindfulness skill was unavailable for usage and as a result, many customers may have experienced difficulties accessing the skill.  The issue was temporary and we encourage you to try out the skill again.—The Amazon Alexa Team\n**********************************************\nNote: The Alexa Voice Service limits the amount of audio that can be played back to 90 seconds, hence this skill only supports 1 minute today. GOOD NEWS: we are preparing for an update in the coming weeks that will allow for you to request a 3, 5, 10, 15, or 30 minute meditation! Stay Tuned for that update!\n\n1-Minute Mindfulness from Walking Affirmations is a skill that allows you to take a break from the world around you and enter into a one minute sound meditation. Practicing mindfulness improves both mental and physical health. Mindfulness involves both concentration (a form of meditation) and acceptance. Many people struggle with how to begin meditating and get the rewards of a more contemplative life, so this skill is the perfect way to start a meditation practice. You can change your life, and change the world... one minute at a time. \n\nAs your meditation begins, remember all you have to do is focus on your breath. However this is harder than it seems. As your mind begins to wander, notice it, accept it lovingly and return your focus to your breathing. Its a little like training a puppy. As your mind thinks of other things, lovingly and gently return the focus to your breath. In time you will be able to stay present and focused for the full length of time. \n\nThere are several different meditations available. You can ask for a peaceful meditation or one with specific sounds. You can ask for a quick meditation or a forest meditation. You can also ask for a river meditation. Each of these one minute meditations will play a related meditative soundtrack to help you tune out the world and focus on your breath.\n\nHere are some examples of what you can say:\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a quick meditation""\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a 1 minute meditation""\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a minute meditation""\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a peaceful meditation""\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a river meditation""\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a forest meditation""",3.7,89,"B01BN1DYBQ","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.d5cd74c4-4884-41fe-a8af-d9330a2fd53e","2016-02-10 18:37:51","mindfulness","Alexa, Ask Mindfulness for a minute meditation.","Alexa, Ask Mindfulness for a forest meditation.","Alexa, Ask Mindfulness for a peaceful meditation.","https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/7758923","","No"

"Air Boss",,"Drew Firment","On March 3, 1969 the United States Navy established an elite school for the top one percent of its pilots. Its purpose was to teach the lost art of aerial combat and to insure that the handful of men who graduated were the best fighter pilots in the world. They succeeded. Today, the Navy calls it Fighter Weapons School. The flyers call it: TOP GUN.\n\nThe Air Boss skill is inspired by my brother-in-law, Commander Bert ""Fred"" Sanford.  As a combat naval aviator and mini-boss of an aircraft carrier, ""Fred"" developed these set of questions to test if you're ready to be launched off an aircraft carrier at 180 miles per hour.\n\nThis skill is dedicated to the United States Armed Forces in appreciation of their sacrifices and successes.

"Airport METAR Reader",,"Dave Jacobowitz","This skill obtains weather data from US (and some international airports) and reads it aloud in the same format that a pilot would hear if he tuned his radio to the airport weather station. (ATIS)\n\nThe data comes from METARS, which are hourly reports available digitally at http://www.aviationweather.gov.\n\nThe formats of a METARs and of ATIS, though similar, and carrying mostly the same information, are different. This skill attempts to translate the METAR data to be as close to ATIS as possible. This means using ICAO aviation phonetics where appropriate and translating wind directions from true-north referenced (METAR) to magnetic-north referenced (ATIS).\n\nThere are two ways to specify the station you want to hear. The first is by city name. (The app does not currently understand airport names.) The second is by a three or four letter ICAO airport identifier. If you only provide three letters, the skill prepends a 'K' -- that is, it assumes you are referencing a US airport. You can specify any airport worldwide by providing all four letters. The letters must be provided using ICAO phonetics (alpha, bravo, charlie, etc.)\n\nThis release (2016Q4) adds some new features:\n\n- Get the time in Zulu, like this:\n\n ""Alexa, ask airport weather to report zulu time""\n\n- set a preferred compass reference\n\n""Alexa, ask airport weather to set wind reference to magnetic"" or\n""Alexa, ask airport weather to set wind reference to true""\n\n- set a preferred visibility unit:\n\n""Alexa, ask airport weather to set visibility to miles""\n""Alexa, ask airport weather to set visibility to kilometers""\n\nWhen in kilometer mode, the visibility report will say ""kilometers"" (or ""meters""). When in miles mode, the unit will not be stated.\n\n- set a preferred altimeter setting unit:\n\n""Alexa, ask airport weather to set altimeter to inches""\n""Alexa, ask airport weather to set altimeter to millibar""\n\nWhen in millibar mode, the altimeter will be prefaced by ""QNH"". When in inches mode, the units will not be stated.\n\n- default airports""\n \nFirst, use the app, specifying an airport as usual. Once it has completed successfully, issue the following command: \n\n""Alexa, ask airport weather to set local airport.""\n\nThe last successfully read station will become the default. From that point forward you can say:\n\n""Alexa, ask airport weather for local"" or\n""Alexa, ask airport weather for atis""\n\nThe stored default airport will be used. \n\nFeel free to contact me with suggestions: dave@toolsofourtools.org\n\nCode itself is hosted on github, if anyone wants to add features and make a pull request:\nhttps://github.com/djacobow/alexa_metar",3.8,19,"B01F9KW5G2","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.74a477b4-fe89-452d-8aa2-9cb6d89391ff","2016-05-19 20:38:37","airport weather","Alexa, ask airport weather to get Cincinnati","Alexa, ask airport weather to read the metar at kilo echo whiskey romeo","Alexa, ask airport weather to get the atis at juliet foxtrot kilo","","","No"

"Almond",,"Securifi Inc.","Almond brings its Wi-Fi and SmartHome controls to Alexa with features such as Parental controls, Guest Networks, Scenes and Modes.\n\nHave kids? Almond offers enhanced Wi-Fi features for Alexa like Parental Controls. Blocking your kids’ devices is as easy as saying “Alexa, tell Almond to disable kids Internet.” Sorry kids. You’re welcome mom and dad.\n\nHaving a party? Everyone’s going to ask you for Wi-Fi access. Not a problem. You can enable and disable the guest network with a simple voice command like “Alexa, tell Almond to enable guest network” and have the guest Wi-Fi username and password sent to you via email. You can share this with your guests as you like.\n\nScenes enable you to perform a series of simultaneous actions with a single voice command. For example a single scene can dim all the lights and set the temperature just right for that special dinner date. To activate a scene named 'Dinner' say, ""Alexa, tell Almond to activate Dinner Scene"" or say, ""Alexa, tell Almond to set Dinner Scene"". \n\nWhat’s more, you can also activate and easily switch between Almond's two types of modes: Home and Away using commands like “Alexa, tell Almond to be in Home mode”' or “Alexa, I'm going away.” Modes are key to automating your home and home security. They let you choose what devices are automatically triggered as part of the home automation rules you create in the Almond App.\n\nPlease note the minimum requirements for using Alexa with Almond:\nYou have an Almond +/Almond 2015 router with the updated firmware.\nAlmond+ : AP2-R089-L009-W016-ZW016-ZB005\nAlmond 2015 : AL2-R095\n\nYour mobile App (iOS/Android) is updated to the latest version.\nAlmond v6.81b on Android\nAlmond v2.4.2 on iOS\n\nAn Almond account that you can create using the Almond App.\n\nSETUP: Enable the skill on Alexa and use your Almond account credentials to login",3.5,4,"B01BLPITFK","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.0afff5d3-1615-4c87-af8d-f9e116998d33","2016-02-09 12:06:04","almond","Alexa, tell Almond to enable Guest Wi-Fi","Alexa, tell Almond to stop Kids Internet","Alexa, tell Almond to activate Party Scene","https://connect.securifi.com/prpo","https://connect.securifi.com/tou","No"

Find more information about connecting Smart Home devices at http://amzn.to/291lR7u\nWhen using the skill, you need to specify by name which device or sensor to use. There are two ways to define this/these names:\n• Use the name(s) you set up already – these are shown in the Almond app and can be changed, or\n• Create an Alexa group, like Bedroom or Downstairs, and add the device(s) or sensor(s) to the group. More information at http://amzn.to/2965dCE\n\nOnce you know the name or group of your device(s), you can say the following: \n* If you have switches or non-dimmable lights, you can turn them on/off, for example: “Alexa, turn on my Bedroom lights”.\n* If you have dimmable lights, you can change the brightness, for example: “Alexa, brighten Downstairs to 60 percent"", or ""Alexa, dim the Living Room lights"".\n* If you have thermostats, you can change the temperature, for example: “Alexa, lower Bedroom by 3 degrees”, or “Alexa, set Downstairs temperature to 72”.\n\nFor more advanced router features such as controlling guest network, blocking devices, and activating scenes and modes, go to the Skills section in the Alexa App, search for the ‘Almond’ skill and enable it.

For example, if your address was 350 5th Avenue, 10118, when prompted for your house number, you would say ""three fifty"".\n\nNext, Bike Share will ask for your street name. Using the above example address, you would say ""fifth avenue"".\n\nFinally, Bike Share will ask for your zip code. In the above example, you would answer, ""one zero one one eight"".\n\nOnce saved, you can then ask at any time to find the closest bike. Just say: ""find me a bike.""\nAlexa will remember your address indefinitely, so you'll never need to add an address again unless you move your Echo. \n\nIf you need to change your address, just tell Bike Share: ""change my address"".

Please give me a chance to correct the issue.\n\nFAQ:\nCan I be prompted for the information?\n* Yes - just say, 'open chicago trains', and when instructed say, 'help'.  \n\nWhy can't this skill find my station?\n* First check with metrarail.com to see the exact station name that Metra publishes for the station.  For example, there is no 'tinley park avenue'.  There is 'tinley 80th' and 'tinley park'\n* Metra publishes their data in GTFS format, and the station names are published for visual consumption, which is not how you might normally speak the station name.  For example, in the ME route the station name '55th - 56th - 57th St.' is how the name is published.  But you cannot say, '55th space dash space 56th space dash  etc'.  So I have tried to add aliases for these kinds of stations.  If your station is not recognized, send me an email with the route, station name, and what you know the station as and I will add an alias for that station for you.\n\nWhat names can I use for the Chicago stations?\n* There are a number of Alias names for the downtown stations.\nOTC or Ogilvie Transportation Center is also known as downtown, chicago, Ogilvie, Ogilvie Station, Ogilvie Chicago, Chicago Station\nCUS or Chicago Union Station is also known as downtown, chicago, Union, Union Station, Chicago Station\n\nWhat is the general format of request?\nask chicago trains for the next train from {Origin Station} to {Destination Station }\nask chicago trains for the next train from {Origin Station} to {Destination station} {leaving or arriving} around {number} {AM or PM }\nask chicago trains for the next train from {Origin Station} to {Destination station} {Leaving or Arriving} around {number} {AM or PM } on {Day of Week}\n\nWhat New?\n* Specify a Day of the Week\n** You can now specify a day of the week you would like the schedule.  Lets say you are trying to figure out when to get downtown on Friday.  Now you can ask for train schedules like, ask chicago trains for the next train from Crystal Lake to downtown arriving around six pm on Friday\n\nNote:\nThis skill uses the static schedule published by Chicago Metra therefore unforeseen schedule changes and some special holidays will not be available.\n\nHere are some example phrases:\n\nNext Train Example:\nWhen is the next train from Big Timber to Chicago Union Station\n\nWhen is the next train from Crystal Lake to Downtown\n\nFor the next train from Naperville to Chicago\n\nWhen is the next train from Northbrook to Chicago\n\nWhen the next train from Northbrook gets to Chicago\n\nLeaving Around a Time Example:\nWhen is the next train from Northbrook to Chicago leaving around four thirty\n\nArriving Around a Time Example: \nWhen is the next train from Crystal Lake to downtown arriving around eight\n\nWhen you specifying a time, this skill attempts to use the AM version of the time, but if that is in the past it will use the PM version of the time.\n\nLeaving or Arriving Around a Time on a specific day Example:\nWhen is the next train from Crystal Lake to chicago leaving around eight am on Tuesday",2.6,12,"B01DLD360I","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.2d65d56d-0dbc-4fdd-ad48-8c8652595765","2016-04-11 11:02:39","chicago trains","Alexa ask Chicago Trains when is the next train from Big Timber to Chicago Union Station","Tell Chicago Trains to give me the next train from Chicago to Naperville","Ask Chicago Trains for the next train from Northbrook to downtown leaving around four thirty","","","No"

"Control4",,"Control4","Add Alexa to your Control4 Smart Home for added convenience of whole-home automation through voice control. Simple and intuitive voice commands activate smart home scenes and allow you to control individual or groups of devices.\n\nThe Control4 Smart Home Skill supports the full set of Alexa voice commands for controlling lights, thermostats, and fully-orchestrated scenes. Simply say “Alexa, turn on bedtime” to activate the scene that you have set up for your nighty ritual, “Alexa, turn on kitchen cooking” to set the perfect lighting while you prepare dinner, or even adjust a thermostat quickly and easily by saying “Alexa, set the upstairs temperature to 72 degrees”. When naming scenes, use the room name in cases where it is appropriate. For example: Alexa, turn on office lamps.\n\nGet started by adding the Control4 Smart Home Skill, authenticating with Control4, and then simply discover your devices. Visit customer.control4.com to rename devices and scenes to your liking, select which devices and scenes are exposed to your Alexa device, and view a list of voice commands you can use with your system. You can also use the Alexa App to create groups of devices like Bedroom or Downstairs by adding a number of devices to those groups.\n\nWith assistance from your Control4 dealer, you can take voice control of your home a step further with comprehensive scenes. For example, in addition to the lights and temperature, you can add control of shades, audio, video, and so much more into the scenes of your choice. For instance, say “Alexa, turn on away” and every light in the house turns off and all audio/video devices shut down.\n\nThe Control4 Smart Home Skill requires an active Control4 4Sight subscription.

"Converge",,"codedwire","Converge is legendary in the metal, hardcore, and metalcore communities. Converge fans are also legendary for their dedication to the band and for their support of the band. If you are one of those legendary Converge fans, then this Alexa skill is for you.\n\nThe Converge skill allows you to play songs from seven Converge albums (""play aimless arrow""), keeps you up to date with what the band and its members are up to (""tell me the news""), lets you discover what Converge concerts are coming up (""tell me about concerts"") and provides a reference for questions about Converge songs and albums (""tell me about You Fail Me,"" or ""what songs are on No Heroes"").\n\nThe real fun begins when you start a challenge. The Converge skill has over 1,300 song samples from seven Converge albums. The Alexa skill uses these samples for two types of challenges: a song challenge (""start the song challenge"") and an album challenge (""start the album challenge""). In each challenge you'll hear a sample of a Converge song and then be asked to name the song or album.\n\nAs you progress through a challenge, Alexa will keep score. If you get stuck on a track, you can ask for a hint (""give me a hint""), ask for the answer (""tell me the answer"") or skip the song and move on to the next track (""skip""). Be aware that points are deducted for hints, answers given, skipped tracks, and for wrong guesses.\n\nOnce you finish a challenge, Alexa won't forget about you. Alexa remembers your high score and your last score. You can check either score at any time (""tell me my high score,"" or ""what was my last score"").\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, please visit http://converge.codedwire.com and click the ""Contact and Support"" link found at the bottom of the page.\n\nGood luck with the challenges!

You have to kill the monster, recover the treasure and escape the cave. Once you enter the cave you can turn around, move forward or shoot forward. You cannot see but you can feel the cave walls around you, a breeze coming from dangerous pits, the noise of some objects under your feet and the stench from a nearby monster. When you smell it and you are sure it's in front of you, shoot your arrow. Be warned, you only have one arrow and you will have to pick it up if you want to shoot it again.\n\nUse your deduction and spatial reasoning to avoid the pits, locate the monster, kill it and escape the cave with the treasure. Exercise your memory by playing paperless!\n\nThis is a variation of the classic game Hunt the Wumpus (1972) popularized as an example in the book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach. It differs from another version in the skills store in terms of how you move around the cave. Here you play in a smaller cave but you need to keep track of what direction you are facing.\n\nThe first time you open the skill, you will be presented with a tutorial, in the tutorial you play on a 3x3 cave. Refer to the following diagram:\nOOM\nOXO\nAXG\nYou start in the lower left corner facing north (A). W is the monster and G is the treasure. After you collect the treasure head back to the entrance of the cave (A where you started).\n\nAfter you complete the tutorial, you will play in a cave of 4x4 with randomly positioned elements (2 pits, 1 monster, 1 treasure).

"DC Metro Tracker",,"Sean Simpson","Get the most up to date Metro Rail information to stay on top of your Washington, DC commute! Optionally set a default home station to make retrieving Metro info even easier. \n\n============\n**NEW**\n============\nIntegration with www.ismetroonfire.com: Ask Alexa whether the metro is currently on fire! See below for details.\n\n============\nFEATURES:\n============\n* HOME STATION ~ Set a default home station simply by saying something like ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker to set Metro Center as my home station."" Once you have set a home station, Metro Tracker will assume your departure station is your home station unless another departure station is specified. Change your home station at any time simply by re-using the ""set home station"" command. \n\n* LIST TRAINS ~ list all trains scheduled to arrive at a particular station. Try saying ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker to list all trains arriving at Farragut West""\n\n* FILTER LINE ~ Tell Alexa which metro line you are interested in to only receive train times for that particular line. For example, try: ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for the next red line from Gallery Place.""\n\n* FILTER DIRECTIONS ~ Specify a destination to only get trains traveling in the direction you need. Try saying ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for the next train from Union Station to Dupont Circle.""\n\n* AVOID EARLY OFF-LOADING ~ Specifying a destination will return times only for trains going *at least* as far as you need. For example, asking for trains going from Union Station to Dupont Circle will *not* return times for trains only going as far as Farragut North.\n\n* COMMUTE TIMES ~ Get an estimate of how long it usually takes to travel between station A and station B. For example, try saying: ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for a commute estimate between L'Enfant Plaza and Columbia Heights,"" or ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker how long it would take to get to Clarendon from Metro Center.""\n\n*ON FIRE? ~ Find out whether the metro is currently on fire! Just say something like ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker if the metro is on fire,"" and Alexa will query www.ismetroonfire.com to give you the latest report. Hopefully most of the time the answer is no, but if smoke or fire has been reported on any metro lines, Alexa will let you know and tell you which lines are affected. \nShout out to Nick Stocchero, creator of ismetroonfire.com, for making this feature possible. Be sure to follow @ismetroonfire on Twitter to get tweet updates from his website!\n\n============\nBUGS:\n============\nIf you notice any bugs or problems with the app that should be fixed, or if there is a feature you would like to see added in the future, please send an email to dcmetrotracker@gmail.com\n\n============\nNOTES:\n============\n*Metro Tracker only relays information for trains that are at least one minute away. As such, trains that are currently boarding or arriving are not reported when you ask Metro Tracker for train times. This is done in order to make the output more concise, and only give you train times you can actually use (the vast majority of users do not live close enough to a metro station for info on trains currently boarding or arriving to be of use).\n\n*The transit info for Metro Tracker comes directly from the WMATA database that keeps track of all trains in the Metro system. This is generally highly reliable, but the recent safetrack initiative has resulted in some trains along affected routes being excluded from the database. Thus, it's possible there may be a train or two traveling the rails that Metro Tracker doesn't know about.\n\n*If at any time the app responds with ""there is a ghost train to a ghost station..."" this means that there is a train scheduled to arrive, but the WMATA database has no information on what line it belongs to, or where it is going. These are the trains that show up as ""--- --- TRAIN"" on the train arrival boards of metro platforms. Ghost trains sometimes have arrival times associated with them, and sometimes not.",3.1,7,"B01EYZBO38","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.48d300b5-e643-4150-aaff-f8d1b92ed568","2016-05-06 19:08:36","metro tracker","Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for the next orange line to Vienna from Metro Center","Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for delays on the red line","Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for a commute estimate between Metro Center and the airport","","","No"

"Dungeon Adventure",,"Fangtastico","Ravensburg needs your help, an evil necromancer and his monsters have been coming from the dungeon and attacking the town. Your task is to locate the evil necromancer who is somewhere in the dungeon and slay him to save the town. In this dungeon crawling game you will create a character and purchase items from the town such as weapons, armor, potions and spells but beware because the dungeon contains many different types of monsters and traps.\n\nThis is a complete fantasy role-playing game in which Alexa will become the dungeon master. You will create a character, purchase items in the town, travel to the dungeon, fight monsters, level up your character, find chests, get more gold to go back to town and purchase better items. First you will create a character and assign values to your character's attributes of strength, dexterity, intelligence, constitution, perception, charisma and wisdom. The adventure will involve rolling dice to determine the outcomes of various tasks (Alexa will roll the dice for you). Your character's attributes will affect how well your character does during the adventure giving you bonus modifiers that add or subtract from your rolls. You will start in town where you can purchase various weapons, armors, potions and spells to help you during your adventure. You will encounter various types of monsters in the dungeon that you can attack and kill which will give your character experience points that will be used to level up your character.\n\nAlexa will save your character and your dungeon state for you so that you can continue from where you left off (even if you are in the middle of fighting a monster). Dungeon Adventure is a game meant to be played over many sessions and if you die you can always come back and try again with a new character and dungeon environment (and maybe try a different strategy).\n\nIt will be a difficult task to find the evil necromancer and slay him but if you do it you will go down in the dungeon adventure HALL OF FAME. \n\nHelpful Tips:\n\n- Have some healing potions to drink\n- Go back to town after you've acquired more gold to purchase better weapons, armor, potions and spells\n- Keep track of your current hit points (you can always ask ""How many hit points do I have?"")\n- Kill monsters to gain experience points to level up your character (you can always ask ""How many experience points do I have?"")\n- You can drink potions, cast spells, run, open chests, etc even in combat if it is your turn\n- Use MONSTER INFO to help determine how powerful the monster is by getting its stats\n- Sometimes it is better to try to run from a monster than continue fighting\n- you can EXAMINE chests for traps before opening them and if you discover a trap you can try to DISARM it\n- You can always relaunch dungeon adventure and pick up where you left the game\n- You can always interrupt Alexa by saying Alexa and then say what you want to do\n- You will die!\n\nSome of the useful things you can say:\n\nWHERE AM I / LOOK AROUND\nGO / MOVE / TRAVEL / RUN / EVADE (north, west, east, south, etc)\n\nWHAT IS MY (strength, dexterity, intelligence, armor class, level, etc)\n\nHOW MANY (hit points, experience points, etc) DO I HAVE\nHOW MUCH (gold, etc) DO I HAVE\n\nWHAT (weapons, armors, potions, spells, etc) DO I HAVE\nEQUIP / READY / PULL OUT (weapon name)\nWHAT WEAPON AM I USING\n\nWEAR / CHANGE INTO (armor name)\nWHAT ARMOR AM I WEARING\n\nLIST (weapons, armors, potions, spells) FOR SALE\nPURCHASE (item name)\n\nATTACK HIGH, MIDDLE, LOW\n\nDEFEND HIGH, MIDDLE, LOW\n\nHOW MANY HIT POINTS DOES THE (monster) HAVE LEFT\n\nDRINK POTION OF (potion name)\n\nCAST (spell name) SPELL\n\nOPEN CHEST\n\nEXAMINE CHEST FOR TRAPS\nDISARM CHEST TRAP\n\nMONSTER INFO / MONSTER STATS\n\nCALL ME (character name)\nWHAT IS MY CHARACTER'S NAME\n\nLISTEN\n\nGAME STATS\n\nWHO IS IN THE HALL OF FAME\n\nWHAT IS MY CURRENT STATUS\n\nINVENTORY\n\nCHARACTER SHEET\n\nemail: dragula[at]lastridehearse[dot]net",3.3,7,"B01K457ZUS","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.83c405e9-0b21-45e7-a10e-5905632e5d24","2016-08-12 03:37:44","dungeon adventure","Alexa, start dungeon adventure","Alexa, open dungeon adventure","Alexa, begin dungeon adventure","","","No"

The setting explores a spectrum of socioeconomic systems in each of these colonies:\n\n- A capitalist/republican system continues in the Inner System (Mars, the Moon, and Mercury), under the Planetary Consortium, a corporate body which allows the election of representatives but whose shareholders are nominally most powerful.\n- An Extropian/Propertarian system is established in the Asteroid Belt.\n- A military oligarchy rules the moons around Jupiter.\n- An alliance of Scandinavia-style social democracy and Collectivist anarchism are dominant in the Outer System.\n\nFrom there, the setting explores various scientific advances, extrapolated far into the future. Nanotechnology, terraforming, Zero-G living, upgrading animal sapience, and reputation systems are all used as plot points and background.\n\nWith all of this, the game encourages players to confront existential threats like aliens, weapons of mass destruction, Exsurgent Virus outbreaks, and political unrest.\n\nData for this Skill has been sourced from Eclipse Phase materials under the Creative Commons License (http://eclipsephase.com/cclicense)\n\nPlease support this game and its fans by visiting, http://eclipsephase.com.

And when you die in the digital age, what happens to the digital pieces you leave behind? General Electric Podcast Theater takes on those questions in The Message and LifeAfter, unpacking the mysteries of the Internet and the universe.\n\nUse General Electric Podcast Theater to:\n– Listen to episodes of The Message and LifeAfter\n– Pick up where you left off, without missing a beat\n– Pause, resume or skip episodes \n\nThe Message\nFollow the weekly reports and interviews of Nicky Tomalin, covering the decoding of a message from outer space received 70 years ago. Over the course of 8 episodes you’ll get an inside ear on how a top team of cryptologists attempts to decipher, decode, and understand the alien message.\n\nLifeAfter \nWhen you die in the digital age, pieces of you live on forever. In your emails, your social media posts and uploads, in the texts and videos you’ve messaged, and for some – even in their secret online lives few even know about. But what if that digital existence took on a life of its own? Ross, a low level FBI employee, faces that very question as he starts spending his days online talking to his wife Charlie, who died 8 months ago…\n\nBut what feels like an unbelievable gift starts to bring up some very real moral and ethical predicaments, as Ross discovers LifeAfter, the program that brought his wife – and countless others back to life online. But what is “life” if you can be preserved digitally? And if you live online, where do you spend eternity?\n\nInvocation Name: \nGE Podcast Theater",4.5,11,"B01N2R3BN9","amzn1.ask.skill.c4e89c9a-cf37-43c8-869a-9def006b9cc4","2016-12-16 20:49:26","g. e. podcast theater","Alexa, open GE Podcast Theater.","Alexa, tell GE Podcast Theater to play LifeAfter.","Alexa, ask GE Podcast Theater about The Message.","","","No"

"Hanukkah Facts",,"www.drBlankenstein.com","Shalom!  I am so happy you have found my little (but extremely interesting) Hanukkah Fact skill.  I have spent many hours putting together some of the most unique and often unknown facts about the wonderful Festival of Lights.  This Amazon Echo skill has more than 100 hand picked Hanukkah Facts loaded into it.  You would need to read 10 pages of internet search results to find so many facts (trust me).  I even requested & received a bunch of the facts from my AMAZING Mother, Wendy (Thanks Mom!). The logo design is partly hand drawn, and elaborated on in Photoshop by a legendary rock star of an artist, Ed Seeman (who also happens to be my Grandfather). You can see more of his work at his website www.EdSeeman.com (Thanks for the art Grandpa!)\n\nWith the wonders of your Amazon Echo device, all you need to do to learn / or inspire conversations with the young ones about the wonderful and long lived Jewish traditions is ask Alexa.  You will very quickly hear after activating and using this skill a few times, these are very education, fun and important pieces of information to know about Hanukkah (why & how it is celebrated etc.).  \n\nIt doesn't matter if you are a life long devoted Jew, or simply curious to know more about Hanukkah... this is the skill for you!  Especially living in a time such as now that is so heavily driven by consumerism, it's important to remember what Hanukkah is all about.  Getting together with family and friends, lighting the menorah, spinning the dreidel, enjoying some amazing food, listening to music, and continuing the wonderful Jewish traditions of Hanukkah. \n\nAs I am sure you have already noticed, your Alexa enabled device is a wonderful way to share good times, with great people.  I hope this skill adds to your holiday experience, and maybe even taught you a couple of things you might not have previously known.  If you enjoyed using this skill, please tell a friend and leave it a good review... thanks.  With that, I say... Have a fantastic holiday season..

Using HCA you can control, program, and schedule lights and appliances using many popular automation protocols. \n\nUnlike other home control systems, HCA is designed not to just control your home but also to program it. You don't need to accept the simple ""control a device"" using voice offered by some automation solutions. Using HCA you can create an automation solution that responds to your needs by combining multiple device in complex scenarios involving events, time, location, state of the home, etc. into one program. These programs express your intent of how your installation should work.\n\nIn addition to voice control, HCA offers clients for the iPad, iPhone, Android devices, and WIndows. With these client applications you are not locked into an application that displays as it wants to. You can create the page structure you see when interacting with the HCA client on your mobile device.  This can be configured on a device-by-device basis and on a user-by-user basis.  For some users, the display can show a complete set of pages for each room. For other users it can display a smaller set of only selected devices. For least technical users you can create a simple keypad like interface that offers only those actions you want to make available for them.\n\nIn one inclusive package HCA provides for creation and operation of simple to complex automation designs. \n\nThe top 20 feature list:\n\n1. Integrates Insteon, UPB, and other power line technologies\n2. Supports IP addressed IR interfaces\n3. Supports whole-house wireless\n4. Can be used in a client-server mode with multiple simultaneous read-write clients for complete local and remote access to design\n5. Amazon Alexa interaction\n6. Clients for Windows, Android, and iOS\n7. Visual tools for scheduling and programming\n8. Unlimited number of programs to respond to events. Constructed in a graphical manner from over 60 different actions\n9. Supports text based scripts in any scripting language that can utilize the extensive HCA object model\n10. Control interface creates a simplified control oriented user interface\n11. Integrate into the HCA user Interface views of other applications: security, power management, and cameras using HTML views\n12. Send email and SMS messages as part of a program action\n13. Create and view Insteon scenes in a graphical manner and remotely program those scenes into Insteon devices\n14. Bridge power line technologies by using multiple power line interfaces simultaneously. Create bridge maps to automatically translate between different technology commands\n15. Integrates weather data from a variety of sources\n16. Powerful ""whole house modes"" for quick power saving programming\n17. Background design checker quickly locate design problems\n18.

"Hunt the Yeti",,"James Church","Hunt the Yeti (or Yeti Hunt) is an interpretation of the game Hunt The Wumpus (1972). In this game, you guide a hunter through a dark cave to discover the location of the yeti. Once you have helped the hunter locate the yeti, tell the hunter to throw the hunter's only spear in the direction of the yeti. If you are right about the location, you will help the hunter defeat the yeti! If not, the yeti will eventually find the hunter.\n\nIn this version of the game, the hunter is lost in a 5 by 5 cave. There are open pits, bats, and a single yeti. You hear the bats flutter, feel the breeze from the open pit, or smell the yeti near by. Bats will pick the hunter up and drop the hunter in a random (safe) location. If the hunter falls into a pit, the hunter dies and the game is over. If the hunter walks into the yeti, the yeti attacks and the hunter dies. Only the hunter is capable of moving, but the hunter only has one spear, so make it count!\n\nGame features:\n- ""begin game"": Starts a new game.\n- ""how to play"": Reminds the player how to play.\n- ""overview"": Provides a short overview of Hunt the Yeti.\n- ""pause"": Provides a short prompt and allows the player to think.\n\nOnce you are playing the game, there are two actions to remember:\n\n- ""move [direction]"": Moves the hunter in a particular direction.\n- ""throw [direction]"": Throws the spear in a particular direction.\n\nA direction is always north, south, east, or west. The game will guide you about where open rooms are, but it won't tell you what are in those rooms. It's up to you to use deductive reasoning to figure out where the Yeti and other traps are located. Good luck!\n\nYou may also say a direction and the hunter will automatically move in that direction. (For some reason, I have trouble moving the hunter ""south"". Maybe it's an issue with my accent. For that case, I say ""move south"".)\n\nFull source code and acknowledgements are on the game's GitHub page:\nhttps://github.com/jcchurch/HuntTheYetiAlexa",4.2,25,"B01JRE35FG","amzn1.ask.skill.cd76cca4-65d0-4df4-994e-49430b7ed7ed","2016-08-10 07:37:41","yeti hunt game","Alexa, launch Yeti Hunt Game","begin game","move north","","","No"

Interactive Fiction is typically played in text based interpreters, this skill brings it to Alexa.\n\nThe wonderful IF community produced a lot of excellent stories over the last few decades -- check out IF Archive (www.ifarchive.org) -- but note that this skill only provides stories with clear license status. We are working on extending the list of supported stories by finding and white-listing those having permissive licenses and by obtaining explicit permissions from authors. If you are an IF author and can give us a permission to use your stories - please let us know at ifas2.feedback@gmail.com and we will be more than happy to white-list it. Same if you believe a certain story has a permissive license and can be white-listed.\n\nIf you don't know which story to play, just follow the skill's recommendations (""Alexa, ask interactive fiction to help""); in particular ""9:05"" and ""Galatea"" are a good start.\n\nYou can ask the skill to download a new story (e.g. ""Alexa, ask Interactive Fiction to download 9:05"") and the skill will download and start the interactive session: it reads you the piece of the story, then asks you for a command, then reads back the result and so on.\n\nYou can stop at any time - just say ""stop"" at any time and your progress will be saved. When you are ready to resume, just run the skill with your next story command, e.g. ""Alexa, ask Interactive Fiction to answer the phone"".\n\n*** Note that this skill is somewhat of a technical experiment. Unlike many of the Alexa skills, Interactive Fiction stories don't use canned questions and answers so it is sometimes tricky for Alexa to understand very specific commands expected by some of them. Stay tuned; this should improve as Alexa is getting smarter. ***\n\nPlease direct any feedback to ifas2.feedback@gmail.com.

Practice ascending and descending interval ear training while you have a few minutes simply by saying ""give me an interval"", after that, Alexa will keep score for you and update you on your score as you go. \n\nTo ensure proper ear training and an un-biased key center, random starting notes are chosen. After each guess, feedback about your answer being right or not is given; and you're updated with your current score after a few attempts. Be sure to use the correct music interval terms: unison, minor second, major second, minor third, major third, perfect fourth, tritone, perfect fifth, minor sixth, major sixth, minor seventh, major seventh, and octave.\n\nAfter initializing IntervalTrainer with your first interval (""Alexa, as Interval Trainer to give me an interval""), reply back with that interval name (""perfect fourth""), and Alexa will confirm or reject your answer.\n\nTo switch interval directions, simply say ""switch interval direction to descending"" or ""switch interval direction to ascending"".\n\nYou can start over your scoring by saying ""reset score"" and you'll have a fresh scorecard.",4.3,6,"B01EMAVSP4","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.636a33b3-d9eb-4076-ac51-2769dac46135","2016-04-28 02:38:32","interval trainer","Alexa ask Interval Trainer to give me an interval","Alexa ask Interval Trainer for a descending interval","Alexa ask Interval Trainer","","","No"

By entering, you accept our Privacy Notice [http://bit.ly/jw-alexa-privacy-policy] and Terms and Conditions [http://bit.ly/jw-alexa-terms-of-use]. This Skill is intended for adults over the age of 21.\n\nTo launch the skill, say “Alexa, open Johnnie Walker.” After confirming you’re over 21 years old, you can select from 4 different options: Choose a Label, Buy a Bottle, Whisky 101, and Try a Guided Tasting.\n\nIn “Choose a Label”, you can find the perfect blend for yourself or a gift. Through a series of questions about flavor preference and price, Alexa will determine the proper whisky for your palate and offer relevant cocktail recommendations.\n\nIf you’d simply like to buy a bottle of Johnnie Walker, you can choose “Buy a Bottle” and Alexa will help you find the nearest store or delivery option.\n\nWhen you select “Whisky 101”, Alexa will share a random fact about Johnnie Walker or whisky in general. These interesting tidbits make for clever cocktail conversation and provide an easy way to impress your friends.\n\nIn order to “Try a Guided Tasting”, you’ll need one of the core Johnnie Walker Labels on hand: Red Label, Black Label, Double Black, Green Label, Gold Label Reserve, Platinum Label, or Blue Label.

For example, if you commute to work or school from Brooklyn to Manhattan everyday, Alexa will always be prepared to tell you when the next train is coming, and if there is any service changes you need to know about. After Alexa has guided you through the basic setup, you will get the next two trains that are on their way.\n\nYour first time using The L Train, you will be walked through setting up your first train stop, and the direction on the train you regularly travel. If this is your first time using The L Train, you can just ask the L train when its coming by saying ""Alexa, ask the L Train when it's coming"". Alexa will than ask you for the L train station you use the most.  Example stations are; Jefferson Street, 3rd Avenue or Lorimer Street. After your station is recognized, Alexa will ask you for what direction you regularly travel. Example directions are; Towards Manhattan, Towards Brooklyn, West, East, Canarsie or To Eight Ave. Once we have all your settings, whenever you ask The L Train when its coming, you will get precise times to help you schedule your departure. \n\nIf you would like to reset your settings, you can simply say ""Alexa, ask The L train to reset settings"". This will walk you through the startup process. If you fail to complete the startup process, you will be prompted to complete it on next use.\n\nOnce you are all setup, you can always just say ""Alexa ask the L Train"" or ""Alexa open the L Train"", or even ""Alexa run the L Train"" to get your train times in the fastest way possible.

"Morse Coder",,"Kay Lerch","This skill makes you an expert for Morse codes. You can explore three different features.\n\n1) Encode names to Morse code\n===============================\nIf you are interested in Morse codes expressing common US first names, go for something like:\n\n""Alexa, ask Morse Coder to encode <FirstName>"" \n\nwhere <FirstName> is any common first name of your choice.\n\nWith this intent Alexa plays back the corresponding Morse code. Moreover, this skill provides the Morse code to your Alexa App.\nDue to technical limitations by Amazon on audio tags this feature is only supported for names shorter than sixteen letters.\n \n2) Spell out names in Morse code\n===============================\nSimilar to the encode feature of Morse Coder this feature lets Alexa spell out a common US first name of your choice in Morse code. \nThe spell-out feature is designed for newcomers who want to learn Morse code letter by letter. Try out:\n\n""Alexa, spell out <FirstName>"" \n\nwhere <FirstName> is any common US first name of your choice. Once again Alexa even returns the Morse code to your Alexa App.\nDue to technical limitations by Amazon on audio tags this feature is only supported for names shorter than six letters.\n\n3) Exercises / Learn Morse Code\n===============================\nAs soon as you got the basics on Morse codes you can test your comprehension. Start an exercise by saying:\n\n""Alexa, start exercise""\n\nand Alexa starts playing a Morse code and asks you to decode and pronounce the word being played. If Alexa doesn't get what you're saying, try to spell the correct answer.\nIf you are not sure Alexa tries to help you by slowing down the playback speed of the code as soon as you give a wrong answer or wait for several seconds without giving an answer. \nAnother option to simplify things for you is to look in your Alexa App. There you can find the written Morse code along with a spelled version of it (""Di-dah-dit ..."").\nActually the Alexa App is the best resource for you while exercising as you can learn a lot from the cards provided by the Morse Coder.\nOptionally you can skip or cancel an exercise by saying ""Next"" or ""Cancel"". If you need help free to ask for ""Help"" at any time. If you want to listen to a code again, just ask Alexa to ""Repeat"". \nYou can interrupt an exercise at any time by using one of the above features (""Spell out <FirstName>"", ""Encode <FirstName>"") and get back to the exercise just by expressing your guess to last played code. Also ""Repeat"" brings you back to the exercise.\nThe capability of switching between an exercise and the other features helps you researching for the correct answer. \n\nScoring\nFor each word you decode correctly you get points which sum up in your personal score. The score persists throughout one session. \nAlexa starts with asking you to decode a randomly picked word with five letters. \nIf you guess the word, Alexa increases the length of the next word. Otherwise Alexa decreases the length to make things easier for you. \nWords in Morse Coder have a minimum length of three characters and a maximum length of eight characters. \nThe longer a word the more points you get out of an answer. Wrong answers on the other hand could degrade your score. \n\nIf you are switching between the features your score persists and doesn't get lost.\n\n4) General features\n===============================\n""Repeat"" during an exercise plays back a code again in a slower version. It also is an option to get back to your exercise if you switched to the spell-out or encode feature.\n""Next"" or ""Start over"" at any time should guide you to the next random code. The current exercise will be skipped.\n""Stop"" quits the skill and stops the exercise. You are provided with your final score.\n""Help"" gives some information on what to say.\n""Cancel"" stops the current exercise. Alexa will give you the correct word for the current code and asks you to continue with another code.",3.8,7,"B01G4F0B4O","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.c26b1c82-967e-4807-b1c2-e983e820edf1","2016-05-26 07:08:35","morse coder","Alexa, tell morse coder to teach me","Alexa, ask morse coder to encode Michael","Alexa, ask morse coder to spell out the name James","","","No"

If Alexa can locate the actual audio snippet of the author of the quote on YouTube, she will even play the original sound bite for you instead of reading it.  \n\nDesigned for entrepreneurs, software developers, business professionals, or people who need a little inspiration to start their day.  So get motivated and make today the day your dreams come true!  \n\nWe have also designed a t-shirt, poster, and canvas for every inspirational quote you hear which you can purchase on our website http://sexyhackers.com to support the development of this skill.   You can view a preview of the t-shirt design or poster containing the quote she just read in the Alexa Companion App.  \n\nDISCLAIMER :  SexyHackers.com does NOT contain any nudity and is work safe.  It's just a fun website which sells t-shirts, posters, and hats containing motivational quotes.   However, some of these famous quotes may not be suitable for all ages as they may contain adult language.  We feature quotes from business leaders like Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Steve Jobs, Aaron Levie,  Haward Schutz, Blake Mycoskie, Dennis Crowley, Mark Zuckerberg and much more! \n\nWANT US TO ADD A QUOTE: \nIf there is a particular quote you would like us to add send us the information on Twitter @MoreThanRewards and we'll do our best to add it!\n\nHAVING TROUBLE WITH THIS SKILL: The only item we're aware of is if you have more than one echo device, you might need to disable and re-enable the skill again if you add a new echo to your account. This is normal since everything has to resync to the new devices.  So if you're having trouble just disable and re-enable the skill then try again by saying 'Alexa, Motivate Me', all will be good.   \n\nThe other obvious item is some folks have changed their device name to Amazon or Echo, as a reminder, if you do that then you'll need to say 'Amazon Motivate Me' or 'Echo Motivate Me' depending on what you call your echo.   We had one person who didn't realize this and claim the skill didn't work on our review but the problem was they didn't invoke it with the correct echo name.  So before you post a review if you could give us a chance to help you we would love to help you since we have no way to actually contact people who write reviews if they don't contact us. \n\nYou can call our customer support line at 414-326-4100 or email support@morethanrewards.com or do live chat with u s on our website SexyHackers.com, we're open Monday to Friday 8AM to 5PM Central Time. \n\nWe want to make Alexa awesome so if you have any ideas on how to improve this skill just let us know. \n\nTHANK YOU! \nThe SexyHacker.com Team",1,1,"B01G6LOP9S","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.3ecfceda-950d-4673-82f6-25d038344f68","2016-06-06 09:38:32","motivate me","Alexa, motivate me","Alexa, tell motivate me to give me a quote","Alexa, ask motivate me for an inspiring quote","http://www.morethanrewards.com/privacy.htm","http://www.morethanrewards.com/terms-and-conditions.htm","No"

"Navigation Ninja",,"HHJ Engineering","Navigation Ninja (or Nav Ninja for short) can help you find the driving, bicycling, or walking distance between any two US cities. It will also give you an estimate of how long it would take to make the trip! \n\nUsing Nav  Ninja is easy and can be accomplished two different ways. The first method is through a rich interactive conversation - simply ask Alexa to open Nav  Ninja and then answer Alexa’s questions. If you make a mistake don’t worry, Alexa will confirm your choices and even let you “go back” or “start over”. If you need to exit at any time simply say “cancel”. If you are unsure of a question, feel free to say “help”. \n\nOnce you get a hang of the app you may want answers more quickly. The second method allows you to provide all of the information up front and get your answer right away! You simply need to supply two cities and an optional transportation mode (driving, bicycling, or walking). Check out the sample utterances for a few examples. \n\nI hope you enjoy using Navigation Ninja. If you have any issues, ideas on how to improve the app, or general feedback please feel free to leave a review!",2,2,"B01HOQ5PBQ","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.d441dcc6-ff2b-4e0d-bb6c-f5c1a0a7bccc","2016-10-29 13:12:19","nav ninja","Alexa, ask Nav Ninja to find the distance between Dallas, Texas and Seattle, Washington by car","Alexa, open Nav Ninja","Alexa, ask Nav  Ninja what's the distance between Dallas and Atlanta by walking","","","No"
"Navy Wars",,"George Aleksandrovich","Now you can play Navy Wars on the Amazon Alexa! To start a game, open the Navy Wars app and say ""I'm ready"", ""start"", or almost any variation thereof. From there, you go back and forth with the Alexa, guessing tiles and responding to Alexa's guesses.\n\nValid responses for tile guessing include A1, A2, ... J9, J10. Valid responses for Alexa's guesses are variations of ""hit"", ""miss"", and ""sink"". You can use almost any synonym, but it's a good idea to use those keywords somewhere in your response.\n\nIt is recommended to play this game with a pencil and paper at the ready. The game is played on a 10x10 grid, with the letters A through J labeling the up-and-down columns, and the numbers 1 through 10 naming the left-to-right rows. A1 is at the bottom-left, and J10 is at the top-right. There are five ships: an airline carrier of length 5, a battleship of length 4, a submarine and a cruiser of length 3 (that is, two ships of length 3), and a patrol boat of length 2. Place them without overlap or going off of the edge of the grid- don't cheat!\n\nThe game goes on until Alexa detects that one of the players has run out of ships.\n\nA note of warning: the game does not yet save, and so when you exit the app, the game's progress is lost. This is a planned feature, and will be released when it is stable.",2,1,"B01GFGQ4TI","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.d320795f-1e11-4c74-b13b-72f5c29c05fd","2016-06-07 08:08:33","navy wars","Alexa open Navy Wars","Alexa open Navy Wars and start the game","attack C7","","","No"

"Open Study - Chemistry",,"Matthew Horger","This skill's purpose is to utilize Quizlet's 2.0 API with Alexa in order to retrieve set information, such as terms and definitions, for a particular subject - Chemistry. By using a public client id, Open Study connects to Quizlet via a secure request to retrieve JSON data of a given set. Then, Alexa will parse the data received and tell you each term and definition in the set starting with the first term and going in order. In this stage of development, Alexa will help users study the developers (mhorger3) high school chemistry set on quizlet; it has a set ID number of 67672902. This set ID number is built into the lambda function, so for users to study their own sets in the future, they would need to be able to input a number on their phone, possibly via account linking. For future improvements, we will be looking into a skill such that a user can enter an id number of a set and study with it, or be able to select subjects to study from, and/or a quiz option where Alexa will ask you a definition and you respond with the term will be implemented also. With this skill, we hope to aid college students who have very busy schedules and have to rely on multi-tasking at times to study. We hope that auditory learning abilities will be effectively utilized in this skill!",0,0,"B01N2WOVAN","amzn1.ask.skill.ebc791c6-9d78-4735-8141-abf20788396a","2017-01-03 01:19:20","study chemistry","Alexa launch study chemistry","help me with chemistry","","https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KPr9LvTSr2WsERQ47E3FTjWj0u-vZPxywcrfX2ECGNc/edit?usp=sharing","","No"

"PingPong Showdown",,"Dana Young","Got a ping pong table? Let Alexa keep score and make the game even more fun with her wisecracks. This is a full featured skill with more than 25 interactions. Alexa is a great score keeper, but lookout for her sharp humor! She has a sass-meter, so you can adjust it from 0 (off) to 10 (full up). She never forgets the score or when to switch serving. In fact every point and every game you play is stored for bragging rights against rivals. \n\nYou can play both singles and doubles matches. You can sign in so that all match stats are stored for you, or skip sign-in and just play. In addition to the game and match scores, you can also hear what percent of  games and individual points were won/lost vs that opponent, what your win percentage was when serving, and what your longest point streak of the match was.\n\nTo get started, first register by saying 'register a new player'. Then just say, 'Use ping pong and start a match'. Whether it is singles or doubles, you will have a red team and a blue team. Once you've started a match, the only thing to do is tell Alexa who wins a point. Do that by saying 'point blue', or 'point red'. All the rest is coordinated by Alexa. \n\nWhen doing the one-time registration, you will choose a 4-digit number for your player ID and tell Alexa your first name. Then when starting a match, Alexa will prompt players for their IDs and kick off the match.\n\n\nBasic things you can say to get started: \n “Start a match”\n “Start a doubles match”\n “Set the sass-meter to zero.” (0-10)\t\n “Tell me the rules of ping pong”\n“Register a new player”\n “Undo that”\t\nTo give a point to a player, say “Point Red”, or “Point Blue”.\n“Tell me more things I can say”\t\n\t\t\nExamples of more things you can say:\n“What's the score?”\n“Give me a summary of the match” (provides output to the Alexa app as well as verbal)\n“What's the match score?”\n“Who's serve is it?”\n“Tell me how to set preferences”\n“Tell me ways to change the match”\n\nExamples of ways that you can manually override and control the flow of the match:\n“Play games to 21” (or 11)\n“Play best three out of five”\n“Play best three out of five” \n“Play a single game match”  \n“Change the number of serves per turn” (to either 2 or 5)\n“Don't switch sides”\t\n“Change the score”\n“Start a new game”\n\nHere are ways that you can set preferences for what Alexa says during the match:\n“Keep it short” This cuts down on the things Alexa says.\n“Don't switch sides”\n\nYou can save and load your match preferences. Preferences include:\n- Playing to either 11 or 21 points in a game\n- Playing matches with either one game, or best three out of five games\n- Setting of the sass-meter between 0-10\n- Switching sides after serve (on/off)\n- Experienced user mode, where comments are kept short\n\nWhen you say, Save Preferences, the settings of the current match will be stored in your profile. \nTo load your preferences, say, Load Preferences after starting a new match.\n\nYou can always say “stop”, “cancel” or “exit”.",3.6,2,"B01ESOHSLC","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.8cbbec55-1a6a-4eaf-b2f8-c898f8a6be37","2016-07-01 06:57:53","ping pong","Alexa, use pingpong and start a match","what are my options?","register a new player","http://pingpong-showdown.appspot.com/privacy.html","","No"

"Posted Messages",,"Josep Valls-Vargas","Post messages to your personal message board from anywhere (e.g. connected devices or web services) and have Alexa read the messages to you.\n\nFor example, in my home setup I have a Raspberry Pi that monitors a button on my mailbox and a temperature sensor. When the button is pressed, the Raspberry Pi sends a message to the API. Also, every hour, it sends an updated message telling me the temperature in my apartment. When I wake up I can ask Alexa to read my posted messages so I know whether the mail has been dropped already and the temperature outside of the bed.\n\nIn order to post messages to your personal message board, this works as a hosted solution within AWS with an API that receives messages and stores them. In order to use this API you need to provide your Alexa user identifier and use secret to authenticate your requests. You can choose to secure your messages with a timestamp and signature but no other identification is required. The requests are sent over HTTPS to the Amazon API Gateway and stored temporarely in a DynamoDB database. No other information is recorded and all your message data is permanently deleted when messages are purged and also optionally once messages are read.\n\nThe motivation behind this project is described here: https://www.hackster.io/josep-valls/alexa-message-board-324b84\n\nThe first time you open the skill it will provide information about the API endpoint, your user identifier, your secret and a link to the documentation and testing console. You can find the testing console and API documentation here:\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-website-textconsole-a3cnv/messages.html\n\n* You can ask Alexa for help or to remind you of your secret by saying: Alexa, ask Posted Messages for help.\n* If you have too many messages or if you want to get rid of your sticky messages, say: Alexa, ask Posted Messages to delete all my messages.\n* You can ask Alexa to reset your secret by saying: Alexa, ask Posted Messages to reset my secret.\n\nDo you have suggestions or requests for integrations?

We GUARANTEE he'll play you only unique quotes until you've listened to ALL of them. We've also worked hard to make sure Alexa reads the quotes as naturally, and as close to way the original crew member said them, as possible.\n\nAt Majel Tech, we pride ourselves on our best-in-class language recognition. We've spent a lot of time at thinking up anything you might naturally say in requesting Roddenberry's functionality. Go ahead, try it! We think you'll be pleased.\n\nNote: that being said, we're not perfect! If Alexa starts her response with ""A quote from <crew member>"", that means she believes you requested a quote from a random crew member. If you had actually requested a quote from someone in particular, she misheard you (you can always look at the card in the Alexa app to see for sure which crew member the quote is from). Please try again, and if it doesn't work, let us know! We want to continually improve our language recognition, and your feedback helps us do that!

"Smart Cap",,"Tushar","(Requires Raspberry Pi/Dragonboard). Instructions given on the github page mentioned at the end of this description.\n\nWhy:\n\nThere are about 285 million visually impaired people in the world. They are not able to experience the world the way we do. Smart cap aims to provide this missing experience for them. The system uses state of the art deep learning techniques from Microsoft Cognitive Services for image classification and tagging. \n\nWhat:\n\nThe smart cap aims bring the beautiful world as a narrative to the visually impaired. The narrative is generated by converting the scenes in front of them to text which describes the important objects in the scene. Examples of text include 'A group of people playing a game of football', 'yellow truck parked next to the car', a bowl of salad kept on table'. For the first prototype of the system, one line along with some keywords would be played as an audio to the users but in the later versions a detailed description would be added as the feature.\n\nHow:\n\nThe architecture of the system includes Amazon Alexa, Raspberry Pi and online computer vision API's. \n\nA webcam which is retrofitted into a regular cap is connected to the Raspberry Pi. The code give on the github page (mentioned in testing instructions) runs of Raspberry Pi. The function of the code is to capture the image from the webcam and send it to Microsoft API's for recognition task. The response is then inserted to DynamoDB. \nWhen the user asks Alexa to describe the scene, the Alexa Skills Kit triggers Amazon Lambda function to fetch the data from the database (DynamoDB). The correct text is the played as an audio on the Alexa device.\n\n\n#Testing instructions\n1. Speak to Amazon Echo - ""Alexa start smart cap"" (you should hear the response as: ""Sure, You can ask me to describe the scene"")\n2. Speak to Amazon Echo - ""Alexa ask smart cap"" -wait- ""describe the scene"""" (you should hear the response as: ""No data received from device in past one minute""). This makes sure that the Alexa skills kit and dynamoDb are working as expected.\n3. Get the userId. Speak to Amazon Echo - ""Alexa ask smart cap to get the user info"" (you should hear a long code)\n4. Open http://alexa.amazon.com/ and login\n5. In the userId card, you would see a long string\n6. Copy the userId and paste it in aws_dynamodb.py file\n7. Make sure you have python 2.7.9 +. [Terminal] which python. [Terminal] python --version\n8. [Terminal] Run camera_image.py: python camera_image.py (You should see the images in the same folder)\n9. [Terminal] Run ms_visionapi.py: python ms_visionapi.py (You should see the results in the terminal)\n10. [Terminal] Run aws_dynamodb.py: sudo python aws_dynamosb.py (Note: this might require sudo access depending on if you used sudo while doing aws configure. It will tell you if update item succedded for dynamodb)\n11. Speak to Amazon Echo - ""Alexa start smart cap"" - wait - ""describe the scene"". If everything went well, you should now hear some relevant to the image that was capture by the camera \n\nExample: 'I think it is a yellow truck going on the road and the keywords are road, car, trees, sky'\n\nDetailed instructions can be found at: https://github.com/TusharChugh/SmartCap",0,0,"B01HZ9AETK","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.0c211eaf-e37d-411d-b975-8ed7dd51368a","2016-08-26 17:02:36","smart cap","Alexa, ask smart cap to describe the scene","Alexa, ask smart cap to get my user info","Alexa ask smart cap, what is in front of me","","","No"

"Sous Chef Recipes",,"backwardsE LLC","This skill is for the modern home cook who uses their phone as their primary recipe source.  The problem with using your phone as a cook book is that you constantly have to use your hands to turn it on.  This usually involves having to wash and dry your hands, then you have to enter your password because your fingerprint reader doesn't work with damp digits.  It's a huge pain, but no more!\n\nNow you can access your recipes with simple spoken commands.  Simply use the Sous Chef Recipes App available in the Apple App Store and on Google Play to enter your recipes.  Then use your Amazon Alexa enabled device to interact with your recipes in a totally natural way.\n\nOnce you've linked your email address to the app and this skill the first thing you'll want to do is add a recipe.  The app allows you to easily load recipes from the most popular food websites.  Note some websites may require their own login.  You can also load recipes from smaller websites like blogs or enter your own recipes manually as well.\n\nOnce you've added a recipe you'll want to open it.  You can do this in the app or you can simply ask Alexa to do it for you:\n\n""Alexa tell Sous Chef to open the burger sauce recipe.""\n\nHint: Sous is a French word that sounds like the English name Sue.\n\nYou can also check what recipe is open.\n\n“Alexa ask Sous Chef what my current recipe is.”\n\nOnce your recipe is open you'll be able to interact with the ingredients.  Here are some examples of things you can say:\n\n“Alexa tell Sous Chef to list ingredients.”\n\n“Alexa ask Sous Chef how much baking powder.”\n\n“Alexa ask Sous Chef how many potatoes.”\n\nHint: if Alexa doesn't find what you're looking for but you know it's there use the app to simplify the text.  For example you might change “¼ cup (4 oz) unsalted butter melted and cooled” to “4 ounces unsalted butter”.\n\nNext you'll want to go through the steps of the recipe.  For example you can use the following commands:\n\n“Alexa tell Sous Chef to go to the first step.”\n\n“Alexa tell Sous Chef to go to the next step.”\n\n“Alexa tell Sous Chef to go to the fourth step.”\n\n“Alexa tell Sous Chef to repeat step.”\n\nHint: while Alexa is talking you can say “Alexa stop” at any time.  Unfortunately at this time you can't resume from where you left off but hopefully that is a feature we can add in the near future.\n\nRecipes in the Sous Chef App also have a description and notes.  You can access these by asking Alexa to read them aloud:\n\n“Alexa tell Sous Chef to read the description.”\n\n“Alexa tell Sous Chef to read notes.”\n\nHint: Sous Chef will get better at recognizing your recipes over time.  The more recipes that are added the more text we'll have to analyze to improve our speech recognition models.\n\nThat's all there is to it, hands free recipe access at your command.  It's like having your own personal assistant in the kitchen.  With all of Alexa's other great cooking features like timers and measurement conversions you'll be cooking with ease in no time.\n\nPlease use the app to contact us with any questions or comments you may have.  More features are coming soon but let us know if you have any requests.\n\nSavour!\nSous Chef",1,4,"B01LYK4FI5","amzn1.ask.skill.39d8c2eb-b161-4249-80fa-c8a8c3960035","2016-10-10 08:11:44","sous chef","Alexa tell Sous Chef to open the Pad Thai recipe.","Alexa ask Sous Chef how much salt.","Alexa tell Sous Chef to go to the second step.","http://souschef.recipes/privacy.html","http://souschef.recipes/tos.html","No"

"Tennis MatchManager",,"Dana Young","Pros play tennis with a human umpire that coordinates flow of the match and keeps score. They get access to detailed stats to analyze and improve their game. Over years, this data provides insights into their own personal game as well as how best to compete or partner with others. \n\nWith Alexa, you can get this kind of experience at the college, club and recreational player level. Every point you play is stored so you can review statistics and trends to improve your game. \n\nTennis MatchManager coordinates both singles and doubles matches. You can sign in so that all match stats are stored for you long term, or skip sign in and just play. Even skipping sign in will allow you to review all the data about that particular match. In addition to the set and match scores, you can also hear how long you played, what percent of  games and individual points were won/lost vs that opponent, and what your win percentage was when serving.\n\nTo get started, just say 'start a match'.  If you would like to have MatchManager keep track of your match data long term, first register by saying 'register a new player'. Registered players can be added to the match by saying 'add a player'. Whether it is singles or doubles, you will have a red team and a blue team. Once you've started a match, the only  thing to do is tell Alexa who wins a point. Do that by saying 'point blue', or 'point red'. All the rest is coordinated and stored by MatchManager. \n\nOnce the match is set up, strap a Voice Remote for Amazon Echo to one of the player's arms. When they tell Alexa who wins a point, she announces it to the court and coordinates play of the match.\n\nNo wifi at the tennis club? Just use your phone as a hotspot. Need a battery for your Echo? Find them on Amazon. Stuck and need some help? More info up at www.TennisMatchManager.com.\n\nBasic things you can say to get started: \n “Start a match”\t\n“Register a new player”\nTo give a point to a player, say “point red”, or “point blue”.\n“Tell me more things I can say”\t\n\t\t\nExamples of more things you can say:\n“What's the score?”\n“Give me a summary of the match” (provides output to the Alexa app as well as verbal)\n“What's the set score?”\n“Who's serve is it?”\n“Tell me some shortcuts”\n“Tell me ways to change the match”\n\nExamples of ways that you can manually override and control the flow of the match:\n“Play with no add scoring”\n“Don't switch sides”\n“Change to blue team serve”\t\n“Change the set score”\n“Blue team won the game”\n“Start a new game”\n“Start a new set”\t\n If the score gets posted incorrectly, just say what the score should be. For example, say “30 All”\n\t\t\nExamples of combining information that will save time:\n“Start a doubles match with blue serve”\n“Add 206-867-5309 to the red team”\n“Register 425-867-5309”\n\nYou can always say “stop”, “cancel” or “exit”.",1,1,"B01BXCJA7C","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.4cd0a8f9-ba04-409f-8fd1-27b329e4e9e1","2016-02-18 17:24:05","keeper","Alexa, use keeper and start a singles match with red team's serve","give me some help","give me a summary of the match","http://tennismatchmanager.com/privacy.html","","No"

Open the Smart Home screen in the Alexa app, select “Get More Smart Home Skills”, select the WeMo skill and press “Enable Skill”.  The Alexa app will bring you to a page that will allow you to link your Alexa profile and your Wemo home.  For the Wemo authentication server to know what Wemo home to link, you need to establish the link on a mobile device or computer connected to the same network hosting your Wemo products (it’s ok if you’re connected through a 5GHz band and your Wemos are on the 2.4GHz band). In some network circumstances, you may be prompted to provide additional information about your network and your Wemos to ensure the right Wemo home is being linked to your Alexa profile.  The account linking portal will prompt you to turn one of your Wemos ON or OFF during a 2-minute window to verify the Wemo home.  It’s easiest to physically toggle any of your connected Wemo switches using the toggle button on the Wemo hardware.\n \nOnce your Wemo home is verified and linked to your Alexa profile, you can discover your devices by saying, “Alexa, discover my devices” or running a device discovery in the Smart Home screen of the Alexa app.\n \nTo control your devices, say “Alexa turn on/off my <device name>.”  You can also create groups of other ON/OFF devices in the Alexa app to control together.\n \nNow, you can control all the gadgets connected to your Wemo switches without having to reach for your phone or tablet.

"Wink",,"Wink","Say goodbye to fumbling for the light switch when you walk into the dark house with your arms full. Amazon Alexa makes it easier than ever to adjust your Wink-compatible lighting products.  You can use the Wink skill to either turn the lights on/off by saying, for example: \n\n    Alexa, turn on downstairs lamp.\n\nOr dim the lights to a desired setting: \n\n    Alexa, set living room light to 50%.\n\nNote: in order to use Amazon Alexa with Wink-compatible lighting products, you will need the Wink HUB. From there, getting started is easy:\n\n    1. Connect compatible products in your Wink app and set individual names for each lighting product (bedroom lamp, kitchen light, etc.). \n    2. Then, link your Wink account to Echo within the Echo mobile app (Settings > Connected Home > Device Links > Wink).\n    3. From there, say “Alexa, discover new devices.” This can take up to 20 seconds.\n\nYou can also adjust Wink-enabled Nest thermostats with Amazon Alexa either incrementally or to a specific temperature, making in-home climate control easier than ever. Put this Wink skill into action by saying, for example:\n\n    Alexa, increase bedroom by 3 degrees.\n\n    Alexa, set living room to 70 degrees.\n\nNote: as with lighting products, in order to use Amazon Alexa with Wink-enabled Nest Thermostats, you will need the Wink HUB. After a few simple steps, you’re ready to go:\n\n    1. If you haven’t already, first set up your Nest account and name each thermostat you have (living room, bedroom, kitchen, etc.).\n    2. Next, connect your Nest account with your Wink app. Your Nest Thermostat will appear in the Wink app as “[location] + [name] + [the word ‘thermostat’]. ""Home Living Room Thermostat,” for example.\n    3. Then, link your Wink account to Echo within the Alexa mobile app (Settings > Connected Home > Device Links > Wink). \n    4. Finally, say “Alexa, discover devices.” This can take up to 20 seconds. Your Nest Thermostat will then appear in the Alexa app as [name] i.e. “Living Room” or “Bedroom.”",4.4,130,"B01EIQYF3E","amzn1.ask.skill.013efdab-897c-4dff-9728-ac679242d818","2016-04-19 18:46:31",,"","","","http://www.wink.com/legal/","http://www.wink.com/legal/","No"
