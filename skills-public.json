      "description": "1-Minute Mindfulness from Walking Affirmations is a skill that allows you to take a break from the world around you and enter into a one minute sound meditation. Practicing mindfulness improves both mental and physical health. Mindfulness involves both concentration (a form of meditation) and acceptance. Many people struggle with how to begin meditating and get the rewards of a more contemplative life, so this skill is the perfect way to start a meditation practice. You can change your life, and change the world... one minute at a time. \n\nAs your meditation begins, remember all you have to do is focus on your breath. However this is harder than it seems. As your mind begins to wander, notice it, accept it lovingly and return your focus to your breathing. Its a little like training a puppy. As your mind thinks of other things, lovingly and gently return the focus to your breath. In time you will be able to stay present and focused for the full length of time. \n\nThere are several different meditations available. You can ask for a peaceful meditation or one with specific sounds. You can ask for a quick meditation or a forest meditation. You can also ask for a river meditation. Each of these one minute meditations will play a related meditative soundtrack to help you tune out the world and focus on your breath.\n\nHere are some examples of what you can say:\n\"Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a quick meditation\"\n\"Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a 1 minute meditation\"\n\"Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a minute meditation\"\n\"Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a peaceful meditation\"\n\"Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a river meditation\"\n\"Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a forest meditation\"\n\nYou can also use the example phrases below as your guide.

      "description": "This skill obtains weather data from US (and some international airports) and reads it aloud in the same format that a pilot would hear if he tuned his radio to the airport weather station. (ATIS)\n\nThe data comes from METARS, which are hourly reports available digitally at http://www.aviationweather.gov.\n\nThe formats of a METARs and of ATIS, though similar, and carrying essentially the same information, are different. This skill attempts to translate the METAR data to be as close to ATIS as possible. This means using ICAO aviation phonetics where appropriate and translating wind directions from true-north referenced (METAR) to magnetic-north referenced (ATIS).\n\nThere are two ways to specify the station you want to hear. The first is by city name. (The app does not currently understand airport names.) The second is by a three or four letter ICAO airport identifier. If you only provide three letters, the skill prepends a 'K' -- that is, it assumes you are referencing a US airport. You can specify any airport worldwide by providing all four letters. The letters must be provided using ICAO phonetics (alpha, bravo, charlie, etc.)\n\n\n\nThere are also a couple of experimental features you might try, but are not fully tested as yet:\n\n- Get the time in Zulu, like this:\n\n \"Alexa, ask airport weather to report zulu time\"\n\n- set a default airport \n \nFirst, use the app, specifying an airport as usual. Once it has completed successfully, issue the following command: \n\n\"Alexa, ask airport weather to set default airport.\"\n\nThe last successfully read station will become the default.\n\nFrom that point forward you can say:\n\n\"Alexa, ask airport weather to get default\"\n\nThe stored default airport will be used. I'm still trying to think of a better way to phrase this, so feel free to contact me with suggestions.",

For example a single scene can dim all the lights and set the temperature just right for that special dinner date. To activate a Scene named Dinner say, \"Alexa, tell Almond to activate Dinner Scene\" or say, \"Alexa, tell Almond to set Dinner Scene\".\n\nHome/Away Modes together with our rules enable you to create intuitive automation. For example, when you arrive home between 6:00-9:00 p.m. weekdays, Almond will disarm the alarm, turn on the porch light for five minutes, and then set the thermostat to 70 F. To set a Mode on Almond using Alexa, you can say, \"Alexa, tell Almond to be in Home Mode\", or simply say \"I am Home\" after starting the skill. \n\nPlease note the minimum requirements for using Scenes and Modes with Almond:\nYour have an Almond +/Almond 2015 router with the updated firmware.\nAlmond+ : AP2-R085-L009-W016-ZW016-ZB005\nAlmond 2015 : AL2-R091\n\nYour Almond App (iOS/Android) is updated to the latest version.\nAndroid v6.0\niOS v2.0\n\nAn Almond account that you can create using the Almond App.\n\nSETUP: Enable the skill on Alexa and use your Almond account credentials to login",

Stay tuned for support for more bike share systems across the country!\n\nBike Share allows you to quickly find the closest bike share station to your address with bikes available! Use it on the way out of the house in the morning to avoid walking to an empty station. If a station has less than 3 bikes available, Bike Share will also let you know  the next station that is more populated. \n\nFirst, you need to add the address where your Amazon Echo resides. Start by saying:\n\"Add an Address.\"\n\nAlexa will prompt you, step by step, to add your address, starting with your house number. For example, if your address was 350 5th Avenue, 10118, when prompted for your house number, you would say \"three fifty\".\n\nNext, Bike Share will ask for your street name. Using the above example address, you would say \"fifth avenue\".\n\nFinally, Bike Share will ask for your zip code. In the above example, you would answer, \"one zero one one eight\".\n\nOnce saved, you can then ask at any time to find the closest bike. Just say: \"find me a bike.\"\nAlexa will remember your address indefinitely, so you'll never need to add an address again unless you move your Echo. \n\nIf you need to change your address, just tell Bike Share: \"change my address\". Alexa will ask if you want to overwrite your current address; if you respond \"yes\", you will be given the chance to enter a new address.",

But she will fire back!\n\nGeneral Instructions:\nAlexa and you will be in at war!\nShe will have her own grid and you can create yours on a piece of paper, or just keep it in mind!\nGive her the coordinates where you want to fire (\"fire at 'B', 2\" for example) and she will tell you if you hit or if you missed.\nThen she will give you some coordinates where she wants to fire and will ask you if she hit or missed (be honest with your answer).\nThe first person sinking the other's ships will win!\n\nFlow:\n1) At first you will be prompted if you want instructions (recommended for the first time) or not.\n2) Then you will be prompted if you want to play a \"quick game\" (recommended for the first time) or an \"advanced game\".\n3) The game begins, she will prompt you for where you want to fire, and will tell you if you hit or missed.\n4) Alexa will tell you where she fires, and you will be prompted to tell her if she hit or missed.\n5) 3 and 4 will repeat until you or she wins, or until you say \"STOP\".\n\nNote:\nThe \"quick game\" is a 3 by 3 grid with one ship of 2 cases.\nThe \"advanced game\" will allow you to create bigger grids, with more boats (all 2 cases long for now).\n\nNote - BUG:\nIf you choose to use an advanced game with a grid of a size 5 of bigger (then from 'A', 1 to 'E', 5) you will encounter difficulties to fire on the line 'E'.

So, when the list is read to you, there isn't anything to differentiate the recipes. The companion app will display the search results with a picture, immediately after the search is completed. The voice command to try a recipe is, Try recipe one, two, three or four. In the app, click the star icon on the recipe you want to try.\n\nTrying a recipe will create a new current Recipe page and an Ingredients and Instructions list.\n\nTo navigate and hear ingredients or instructions list items use the GET voice command. \n\nVOICE COMMANDS \nUpdated: 5/17/2016\n\n--------------------------------------\nOPEN\n- Alexa, open Chef Sheffey.\n\n--------------------------------------\nFIND\nFind a recipe with a one to five word search phrase.\n\n- Find cherry pies\n- Find orange chicken recipes\n- Find green bean casseroles\n- Find honey glazed ham recipes \n\nAvoid using words like \"a\", or \"an\", or \"the\".\n\n--------------------------------------\nREAD SEARCH\nGets search results list and reads title of first recipe.

Alexa will reply with how many buses are en route and what time they're estimated to arrive.  \n\nDon't know your bus stop number?  It's on the bus stop sign.  Not standing in front of your bus stop sign?  You can use their online bus tracker.  Select your stop and you'll see the stop number listed in the \"Find By Stop #\" box in the top left under the logo.\n\nhttp://www.ctabustracker.com/bustime/eta/eta.jsp\n\nYou can also give Alexa the direction, route number, and cross streets/stop name to get estimates.  If you choose to use this method currently you'll need to know the exact name of the stop/cross streets that the CTA uses in their API.  Typically it's the bus route's street name first then the cross street.  For example if you're wanting the northbound 22 bus at Addison you'd need to request \"...northbound 22 bus at Clark & Addison.\"  If you're looking for stops like \"Fullerton Red Line\" you're not going to have a good time :/ CTA has it as 'Fullerton & Sheffield (Red/Brown/Purple Line)'.  Hopefully, in a future release we'll be able to handle these request more efficiently and intuitively.\n\n\nSend all praise, issues, feedback, hate mail to alexa.bustracker@gmail.com.  If you do have trouble using it and email me send along what date & time you were bus tracking so I can look back in the logs to see what was going on.\n\nThanks and keep on tracking!",

An Alexa Skill that answers questions about your favorite comic book characters and their universes. \n\nComic Book Guide answers questions about your favorite comic book characters, teams, locations, and objects!\n\nThere are two ways you can activate Comic Book Guide.\n1) Simply say \"Alexa, start Comic Book Guide.”\n2) Begin by asking a question, for example, you can say “Alexa, ask Comic Book Guide who is Batman?” \n\nWhile Comic Book Guide is running, you can ask it additional questions that are unrelated to the character previously asked about, like “What is Spider-Man’s birthday?”, or “Who are the Avengers?”\n\nIf you don't name a subject in a question, Comic Book Guide will answer for the last subject you asked about. For example, if you ask \"Who is Captain America?\", then you only need to ask \"What is his birthday?\", to hear when Captain America was born. \n\nYou can exit Comic Book Guide by saying exit, end, or close.\n\nHere is a small sample of questions you can ask Comic Book Guide:\n\"Tell me about Metropolis.\"\n\"What is the Infinity Gauntlet?\"\n\"What are some of Cyclops' other names?\"\n\"When was Rogue born?\"\n\"What was the first appearance of the X-Men?\"\n\"How many comic books has Superman appeared in?\"\n\"What powers does Aquaman have?\"\n\"Who publishes comic books with Lex Luthor?\"\n\"What is the birth name of Harley Quinn?\"\n\"What teams has Deadshot been a member of?\"\n\nComic Book Guide uses information from the Comic Vine API (http://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/) and the Marvel API (http://developer.marvel.com/).",

      "description": "Get the most up to date Metro Rail information to stay on top of your Washington, DC commute! Optionally set a default home station to make retrieving Metro info even easier. \n\n============\n**NEW**\n============\nIntegration with www.ismetroonfire.com: Ask Alexa whether the metro is currently on fire! See below for details.\n\n============\nFEATURES:\n============\n* HOME STATION ~ Set a default home station simply by saying something like \"Alexa, ask Metro Tracker to set Metro Center as my home station.\" Once you have set a home station, Metro Tracker will assume your departure station is your home station unless another departure station is specified. Change your home station at any time simply by re-using the \"set home station\" command. \n\n* LIST TRAINS ~ list all trains scheduled to arrive at a particular station. Try saying \"Alexa, ask Metro Tracker to list all trains arriving at Farragut West\"\n\n* FILTER LINE ~ Tell Alexa which metro line you are interested in to only receive train times for that particular line. For example, try: \"Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for the next red line from Gallery Place.\"\n\n* FILTER DIRECTIONS ~ Specify a destination to only get trains traveling in the direction you need. Try saying \"Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for the next train from Union Station to Dupont Circle.\"\n\n* AVOID EARLY OFF-LOADING ~ Specifying a destination will return times only for trains going *at least* as far as you need. For example, asking for trains going from Union Station to Dupont Circle will *not* return times for trains only going as far as Farragut North.\n\n* COMMUTE TIMES ~ Get an estimate of how long it usually takes to travel between station A and station B. For example, try saying: \"Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for a commute estimate between L'Enfant Plaza and Columbia Heights,\" or \"Alexa, ask Metro Tracker how long it would take to get to Clarendon from Metro Center.\"\n\n*ON FIRE? ~ Find out whether the metro is currently on fire! Just say something like \"Alexa, ask Metro Tracker if the metro is on fire,\" and Alexa will query www.ismetroonfire.com to give you the latest report. Hopefully most of the time the answer is no, but if smoke or fire has been reported on any metro lines, Alexa will let you know and tell you which lines are affected. \nShout out to Nick Stocchero, creator of ismetroonfire.com, for making this feature possible. Be sure to follow @ismetroonfire on Twitter to get tweet updates from his website!\n\n============\nBUGS:\n============\nIf you notice any bugs or problems with the app that should be fixed, or if there is a feature you would like to see added in the future, please send an email to dcmetrotracker@gmail.com\n\n============\nNOTES:\n============\n*Metro Tracker only relays information for trains that are at least one minute away. As such, trains that are currently boarding or arriving are not reported when you ask Metro Tracker for train times. This is done in order to make the output more concise, and only give you train times you can actually use (the vast majority of users do not live close enough to a metro station for info on trains currently boarding or arriving to be of use).\n\n*The transit info for Metro Tracker comes directly from the WMATA database that keeps track of all trains in the Metro system. This is generally highly reliable, but the recent safetrack initiative has resulted in some trains along affected routes being excluded from the database. Thus, it's possible there may be a train or two traveling the rails that Metro Tracker doesn't know about.\n\n*If at any time the app responds with \"there is a ghost train to a ghost station...\" this means that there is a train scheduled to arrive, but the WMATA database has no information on what line it belongs to, or where it is going. These are the trains that show up as \"--- --- TRAIN\" on the train arrival boards of metro platforms. Ghost trains sometimes have arrival times associated with them, and sometimes not.",

      "description": "Dice Bag rolls a number of multi-sided dice.  You can use Dice Bag as a dice replacement or companion for your rolling needs.\n\nJust Roll: Roll the standard 6 sided dice by saying \"roll my dice\" to automatically roll two 6 sided dice.  Example: \"Alexa, ask Dice Bag to roll my dice.\"\n\nRoll Multi-sided: Roll a number of multi-sided dice.  An example command would be \"roll 7 d 20\" or \"roll 7 twenty sided dice\" to roll 7 twenty sided dice.  The maximum number of dice to roll at one time is 100.  Example: \"Alexa, ask Dice Bag to roll seven d twenty.\"\n\nLast Roll: Forget your last roll?  Ask Dice Bag \"what was the last roll?\"  Example: \"Alexa, ask Dice Bag what was my last roll?\"\n\nRe-Roll: To re-roll the last set of dice, just say \"re-roll\" or \"roll again.\"  Example: \"Alexa, as Dice Bag to roll again.\"\n\nSee Who Goes First: Dice Bag can also help determine the first player, as is common in many board games.  Simply ask Dice Bag \"who goes first.\"  Then tell Dice Bag the number of players.  The maximum number of players who can roll for first player at one time is 15.  Example: \"Alexa, ask Dice Bag to see who goes first.\"\n\nRoll Initiative: For specialized gaming needs, initiative has been added to help players determine the order of character actions during encounters.  Say \"roll for initiative,\" then tell Dice Bag the number of players.  The specified number of d20 will be rolled.  The maximum number of players who can roll for initiative at one time is 15.  Example: \"Alexa, ask Dice Bag to roll for initiative.\"\n\nRoll Percent: Dice Bag can also roll percent dice.  Just say \"roll for percent.\"  Example: \"Alexa, ask Dice Bag to roll for percent.\"\n\nDice Bag will voice up to 15 dice results at a time, otherwise just the total is voiced.  You can view up to 50 roll results in the Alexa App.\n\nTo get basic instructions, say \"Alexa, open Dice Bag.\"",

He must've had DiceBot on his side.\n\n**Note: This super secret description does not exist in DiceBot's help menu, so that nobody can inadvertently stumble upon DiceBot's cheating ways during conversation.\n\nDiceBot listens for special patterns, and that's how it knows to switch out the fair dice with loaded dice.\n\nTo roll fair dice, just say something like \"Roll three dice\" or \"roll a d20\".\n\nTo roll dice that are weighted for higher numbers, replace \"roll\" with \"roll me\", as in \"roll me three dice\" or \"roll me a d20\".\n\nAlternately, dice can be weighted downward by ending the sentence with \"for me\", for example \"roll three dice for me\" or \"roll a d20 for me\".\n\nDiceBot's cheating is subtle - it shifts rolls on average by about 10% - and it's still possible to roll all values on a given die. Even with loaded d20, you still might roll a critical failure!\n\nFurther examples and instructions can be found at www.derpgroup.com/bots.html#2",

If you don’t have a Pizza Profile, set one up at www.dominos.com. You’ll also need an Easy Order or a recent order saved within your Pizza Profile. Once you’ve placed your order, you can ask Alexa for Domino’s Tracker® updates at each stage, from the time it’s placed to when it’s ready for delivery or pickup. Alexa will simply use the phone number saved in your Pizza Profile.\nIf you just want to track your carryout or delivery order from Domino’s, enter the phone number you used with a recent order into the app. Alexa will give you the current status of your order whenever you ask.\n\nTo get started, just say “Alexa, open Domino’s.” Alexa will connect you to Domino’s and get you ordering and tracking in no time.\n\nLearn more about Echo ordering and all the newest ways to order Domino’s at http://anyware.dominos.com/.",

The setting takes place after a World War III project to create artificial intelligence went rogue under the influence of an extraterrestrial entity known as the \"Exsurgent\" (best described as an organic computer virus with the capacity to infect both machines and animals with sapient qualities), resulting in the deaths of over 90% of the inhabitants of Earth.\n\nEarth is subsequently abandoned, and existing colonies throughout the Solar System are expanded to accommodate the refugees. The setting explores a spectrum of socioeconomic systems in each of these colonies:\n\n- A capitalist/republican system continues in the Inner System (Mars, the Moon, and Mercury), under the Planetary Consortium, a corporate body which allows the election of representatives but whose shareholders are nominally most powerful.\n- An Extropian/Propertarian system is established in the Asteroid Belt.\n- A military oligarchy rules the moons around Jupiter.\n- An alliance of Scandinavia-style social democracy and Collectivist anarchism are dominant in the Outer System.\n\nFrom there, the setting explores various scientific advances, extrapolated far into the future. Nanotechnology, terraforming, Zero-G living, upgrading animal sapience, and reputation systems are all used as plot points and background.\n\nWith all of this, the game encourages players to confront existential threats like aliens, weapons of mass destruction, Exsurgent Virus outbreaks, and political unrest.\n\nData for this Skill has been sourced from Eclipse Phase materials under the Creative Commons License (http://eclipsephase.com/cclicense)\n\nPlease support this game and its fans by visiting, http://eclipsephase.com.

This skill will sync with the water intake data that's on the app. You can provide water input data manually on your iPhone, automatically through the H2O-Pal tracker and now you can do it using your voice and this Alexa skill. You also check your water intake status by voice at any time with this skill.\n(Your iPhone must be connected to the internet to ensure that data stays consistent between your phone and the data that's available to Alexa. At this time your phone will sync the data each time the H2O-Pal app is either opened or closed.)\nWe're happy to learn about your experience with H2O-Pal. If you have any suggestions, questions or if you experience an issue just send us an email at support@outofgalaxy.com.\nWe want to help you stay healthy and hydrated =)",

But after 6 misses, you lose the game. \n\nIf you have trouble visualizing the word (a great exercise for your brain, BTW), play along using the Alexa mobile app. Alexa will draw out the number of letters in the word for you, place the correct letters in the right blanks, and list the letters already guessed and the letters left. With each miss, she'll add one more body part to the scaffold until the man is hung or you guess the word and win the game.\n\nGame Tip; Alexa struggles a bit hearing the letter \"E.\" So when you want to guess that letter, instead say a word that starts with an \"E\" like \"every\" or \"elephant.\" She'll get what you mean.",

      "description": "The Home Control Assistant is a full featured Home Automation application. This skill is the voice interface to the HCA Server running in your home. Using HCA you can control, program, and schedule lights and appliances using many popular automation protocols. \n\nUnlike other home control systems, HCA is designed not to just control your home but also to program it. You don't need to accept the simple \"control a device\" using voice offered by some automation solutions. Using HCA you can create an automation solution that responds to your needs by combining multiple device in complex scenarios involving events, time, location, state of the home, etc. into one program. These programs express your intent of how your installation should work.\n\nIn addition to voice control, HCA offers clients for the iPad, iPhone, Android devices, and WIndows. With these client applications you are not locked into an application that displays as it wants to. You can create the page structure you see when interacting with the HCA client on your mobile device.  This can be configured on a device-by-device basis and on a user-by-user basis.  For some users, the display can show a complete set of pages for each room. For other users it can display a smaller set of only selected devices. For least technical users you can create a simple keypad like interface that offers only those actions you want to make available for them.\n\nIn one inclusive package HCA provides for creation and operation of simple to complex automation designs. \n\nThe top 20 feature list:\n\n1. Integrates Insteon, UPB, and other power line technologies\n2. Supports IP addressed IR interfaces\n3. Supports whole-house wireless\n4. Can be used in a client-server mode with multiple simultaneous read-write clients for complete local and remote access to design\n5. Amazon Alexa interaction\n6. Clients for Windows, Android, and iOS\n7. Visual tools for scheduling and programming\n8. Unlimited number of programs to respond to events. Constructed in a graphical manner from over 60 different actions\n9. Supports text based scripts in any scripting language that can utilize the extensive HCA object model\n10. Control interface creates a simplified control oriented user interface\n11. Integrate into the HCA user Interface views of other applications: security, power management, and cameras using HTML views\n12. Send email and SMS messages as part of a program action\n13. Create and view Insteon scenes in a graphical manner and remotely program those scenes into Insteon devices\n14. Bridge power line technologies by using multiple power line interfaces simultaneously. Create bridge maps to automatically translate between different technology commands\n15. Integrates weather data from a variety of sources\n16. Powerful \"whole house modes\" for quick power saving programming\n17. Background design checker quickly locate design problems\n18. Configurable Alert Mechanism for handling exceptional conditions\n19. Many tools for creating, viewing, modifying, and documenting the design\n20. HCA is well documented in extensive User Guide and Video series.\n\nDownload a no-cost 30 day evaluation from www.HCATech.com",

Once your account is created, you need to have at least one authorized ISY in your account. For more information on setting up your ISY on portal: http://www.universal-devices.com/install-module/\nWhen you enable this skill, you will be prompted to link your echo to your UDI portal account. You will have to provide your UDI portal user ID and password. Once the link process is complete, you can start using the skill.\nIf your portal account has several ISYs, you need to start by choosing which ISY you want to control. You can login to portal, go to your profile, and select your preferred ISY. Alternatively, you can say to your echo: \"Alexa, tell izzy to select my preferred I.S.Y.\", and you will be prompted to say which ISY you want to control. You need to say the Alias you assigned to your ISY in portal. If your account has only one ISY, this step is not required.\n\nBefore you can control devices, you also need to configure them in portal at https://my.isy.io. Go to the ISY tab, and use the tool \"Amazon Echo\" on your ISY.\n\nHere's the complete capability list:\nTurn off a device\nTurn on a device\nTurn on a device to x percent\nBrighten device\nDim device\nToggle device\nGet device status\nLock a door\nUnlock a door\nLock all doors (Alexa will lock all devices it recognizes as a lock)\nUnlock all doors\nGet thermostat temperature\nGet/Set thermostat mode\nGet/Set thermostat setpoint for heat or cool\nIncrease/Decrease setpoint\nRun program (runIf only)\nStop program\nGet program status",

In this way, Alexa could be described as an \"Answering Machine.\" \n\nJim Rockford's bulking answering machine represented an automation technology that television viewers in 1974 hadn't considered to be accessible to the private individual. The subtle irony was that this fantastic machine's potential was being squandered with having to accurately dictate the ridiculous ramblings of Angel and Rockford's other colorful associates.\n\nWith the \"Jim Rockford Answering Machine\" Alexa skill, you can likewise squander the magnificent potential of your \"Answering Machine\" by conscripting Alexa to read transcriptions from it's ancestor on Jim Rockford's desk. \n\nTo use, just say, \"Ask Jim Rockford's Answering Machine to read a message.\"",

      "description": "Ask Alexa when the next train is coming to your NYC MTA L train stop, and listen to the current L train status. This app is simply for asking Alexa when the next L train is coming in a particular direction. For example, if you commute to work or school from Brooklyn to Manhattan everyday, Alexa will always be prepared to tell you when the next train is coming, and if there is any service changes you need to know about. After Alexa has guided you through the basic setup, you will get the next two trains that are on their way.\n\nYour first time using The L Train, you will be walked through setting up your first train stop, and the direction on the train you regularly travel. If this is your first time using The L Train, you can just ask the L train when its coming by saying \"Alexa, ask the L Train when it's coming\". Alexa will than ask you for the L train station you use the most.  Example stations are; Jefferson Street, 3rd Avenue or Lorimer Street. After your station is recognized, Alexa will ask you for what direction you regularly travel. Example directions are; Towards Manhattan, Towards Brooklyn, West, East, Canarsie or To Eight Ave. Once we have all your settings, whenever you ask The L Train when its coming, you will get precise times to help you schedule your departure. \n\nIf you would like to reset your settings, you can simply say \"Alexa, ask The L train to reset settings\". This will walk you through the startup process. If you fail to complete the startup process, you will be prompted to complete it on next use.\n\nOnce you are all setup, you can always just say \"Alexa ask the L Train\" or \"Alexa open the L Train\", or even \"Alexa run the L Train\" to get your train times in the fastest way possible. But you an always use more complete phrasing like, \"Alexa, ask the L Train when it's coming?\".\n\nThis skill works for every L train stop in New York City, including Brooklyn and Queens.",

Enjoy effects like Music Visualizer, Candle and Color Cycle, and control your lights from the internet or your favorite devices and apps.\n\nCONTROL LIFX WITH ALEXA\n\nYour LIFX Lights now talk directly to the Amazon Echo through the Alexa Connected Home. After a few simple set up steps you can control your LIFX lights with simple statements like:\n\nAlexa, Turn the lights on\n\nAlexa, Turn the Kitchen light off\n\nAlexa, Switch lights to 50% brightness\n\nAlexa, lower brightness by 25%\n\nAlexa, dim Bedroom lights by 25%\n\n\nAnd to change colors or control your LIFX groups just add \"tell Life-Ex...\":\n\nAlexa, tell `Life-Ex` to make my lights blue\n\nAlexa, tell `Life-Ex` to change the Living Room lights to red\n\n\nHOW TO GET CONNECTED\n\nMake sure your lights are on the LIFX Cloud then follow these steps: \n\n1. Open the Alexa app and go to Link with LIFX under Smart Home > Device Links and login to your LIFX account. \n\n2. Say \"Alexa, discover devices\". Your lights will be displayed under Smart Home in the Alexa app and you can optionally group them for Alexa here (hint: Alexa groups are separate from your personal LIFX groups). \n\n3. Say “Alexa, turn my lights… On” or “...Off”. That's it! \n\n4. Optional: Enable the advanced LIFX Skill, under Skills in the Alexa app, to control LIFX colors and groups. Once activated, say “Alexa, ask 'Life-Ex': what I can do with my lights?” and Alexa will teach you how to control groups of LIFX lights and even set their individual colors.",

      "description": "This skill makes you an expert for Morse codes. You can explore three different features.\n\n1) Encode names to Morse code\n===============================\nIf you are interested in Morse codes expressing common US first names, go for something like:\n\n\"Alexa, ask Morse Coder to encode <FirstName>\" \n\nwhere <FirstName> is any common first name of your choice.\n\nWith this intent Alexa plays back the corresponding Morse code. Moreover, this skill provides the Morse code to your Alexa App.\nDue to technical limitations by Amazon on audio tags this feature is only supported for names shorter than sixteen letters.\n \n2) Spell out names in Morse code\n===============================\nSimilar to the encode feature of Morse Coder this feature lets Alexa spell out a common US first name of your choice in Morse code. \nThe spell-out feature is designed for newcomers who want to learn Morse code letter by letter. Try out:\n\n\"Alexa, spell out <FirstName>\" \n\nwhere <FirstName> is any common US first name of your choice. Once again Alexa even returns the Morse code to your Alexa App.\nDue to technical limitations by Amazon on audio tags this feature is only supported for names shorter than six letters.\n\n3) Exercises / Learn Morse Code\n===============================\nAs soon as you got the basics on Morse codes you can test your comprehension. Start an exercise by saying:\n\n\"Alexa, start exercise\"\n\nand Alexa starts playing a Morse code and asks you to decode and pronounce the word being played. If Alexa doesn't get what you're saying, try to spell the correct answer.\nIf you are not sure Alexa tries to help you by slowing down the playback speed of the code as soon as you give a wrong answer or wait for several seconds without giving an answer. \nAnother option to simplify things for you is to look in your Alexa App. There you can find the written Morse code along with a spelled version of it (\"Di-dah-dit ...\").\nActually the Alexa App is the best resource for you while exercising as you can learn a lot from the cards provided by the Morse Coder.\nOptionally you can skip or cancel an exercise by saying \"Next\" or \"Cancel\". If you need help free to ask for \"Help\" at any time. If you want to listen to a code again, just ask Alexa to \"Repeat\". \nYou can interrupt an exercise at any time by using one of the above features (\"Spell out <FirstName>\", \"Encode <FirstName>\") and get back to the exercise just by expressing your guess to last played code. Also \"Repeat\" brings you back to the exercise.\nThe capability of switching between an exercise and the other features helps you researching for the correct answer. \n\nScoring\nFor each word you decode correctly you get points which sum up in your personal score. The score persists throughout one session. \nAlexa starts with asking you to decode a randomly picked word with five letters. \nIf you guess the word, Alexa increases the length of the next word. Otherwise Alexa decreases the length to make things easier for you. \nWords in Morse Coder have a minimum length of three characters and a maximum length of eight characters. \nThe longer a word the more points you get out of an answer. Wrong answers on the other hand could degrade your score. \n\nIf you are switching between the features your score persists and doesn't get lost.\n\n4) General features\n===============================\n\"Repeat\" during an exercise plays back a code again in a slower version. It also is an option to get back to your exercise if you switched to the spell-out or encode feature.\n\"Next\" or \"Start over\" at any time should guide you to the next random code. The current exercise will be skipped.\n\"Stop\" quits the skill and stops the exercise. You are provided with your final score.\n\"Help\" gives some information on what to say.\n\"Cancel\" stops the current exercise. Alexa will give you the correct word for the current code and asks you to continue with another code.",

      "description": "Just say 'Alexa, motivate me,' and she will randomly read a motivational quote from our database.  If Alexa can locate the actual audio snippet of the author of the quote on YouTube, she will even play the original sound bite for you instead of reading it.  \n\nDesigned for entrepreneurs, software developers, business professionals, or people who need a little inspiration to start their day.  So get motivated and make today the day your dreams come true!  \n\nWe have also designed a t-shirt, poster, and canvas for every inspirational quote you hear which you can purchase on our website http://sexyhackers.com to support the development of this skill.   You can view a preview of the t-shirt design or poster containing the quote she just read in the Alexa Companion App.  \n\nDISCLAIMER :  SexyHackers.com does NOT contain any nudity and is work safe.  It's just a fun website which sells t-shirts, posters, and hats containing motivational quotes.   However, some of these famous quotes may not be suitable for all ages as they may contain adult language.  We feature quotes from business leaders like Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Steve Jobs, Aaron Levie,  Haward Schutz, Blake Mycoskie, Dennis Crowley, Mark Zuckerberg and much more! \n\nWANT US TO ADD A QUOTE: \nIf there is a particular quote you would like us to add send us the information on Twitter @MoreThanRewards and we'll do our best to add it!\n\nHAVING TROUBLE WITH THIS SKILL: The only item we're aware of is if you have more than one echo device, you might need to disable and re-enable the skill again if you add a new echo to your account. This is normal since everything has to resync to the new devices.  So if you're having trouble just disable and re-enable the skill then try again by saying 'Alexa, Motivate Me', all will be good.   \n\nThe other obvious item is some folks have changed their device name to Amazon or Echo, as a reminder, if you do that then you'll need to say 'Amazon Motivate Me' or 'Echo Motivate Me' depending on what you call your echo.   We had one person who didn't realize this and claim the skill didn't work on our review but the problem was they didn't invoke it with the correct echo name.  So before you post a review if you could give us a chance to help you we would love to help you since we have no way to actually contact people who write reviews if they don't contact us. \n\nYou can call our customer support line at 414-326-4100 or email support@morethanrewards.com or do live chat with u s on our website SexyHackers.com, we're open Monday to Friday 8AM to 5PM Central Time. \n\nWe want to make Alexa awesome so if you have any ideas on how to improve this skill just let us know. \n\nTHANK YOU! \nThe SexyHacker.com Team",

From there, you go back and forth with the Alexa, guessing tiles and responding to Alexa's guesses.\n\nValid responses for tile guessing include A1, A2, ... J9, J10. Valid responses for Alexa's guesses are variations of \"hit\", \"miss\", and \"sink\". You can use almost any synonym, but it's a good idea to use those keywords somewhere in your response.\n\nIt is recommended to play this game with a pencil and paper at the ready. The game is played on a 10x10 grid, with the letters A through J labeling the up-and-down columns, and the numbers 1 through 10 naming the left-to-right rows. A1 is at the bottom-left, and J10 is at the top-right. There are five ships: an airline carrier of length 5, a battleship of length 4, a submarine and a cruiser of length 3 (that is, two ships of length 3), and a patrol boat of length 2. Place them without overlap or going off of the edge of the grid- don't cheat!\n\nThe game goes on until Alexa detects that one of the players has run out of ships.\n\nA note of warning: the game does not yet save, and so when you exit the app, the game's progress is lost. This is a planned feature, and will be released when it is stable.",

Use this skill for pure entertainment value, or use the random quote feature to turn it into a drinking game.\n\nAsk Roddenberry for a quote to hear one of a curated selection of the best crew quotes.\n\nExamples of things you can do are: ask Roddenberry to give you a quote from any senior TNG crew member, ask him to surprise you, or ask him to repeat the previous quote.\n\nUnlike Alexa experiences that use simplistic random algorithms, annoyingly repeating the same responses over and over while there's still more to hear, Roddenberry won't repeat any quotes until you've heard them all. We GUARANTEE he'll play you only unique quotes until you've listened to ALL of them. We've also worked hard to make sure Alexa reads the quotes as naturally, and as close to way the original crew member said them, as possible.\n\nAt Majel Tech, we pride ourselves on our best-in-class language recognition. We've spent a lot of time at thinking up anything you might naturally say in requesting Roddenberry's functionality. Go ahead, try it! We think you'll be pleased.\n\nNote: that being said, we're not perfect! If Alexa starts her response with \"A quote from <crew member>\", that means she believes you requested a quote from a random crew member. If you had actually requested a quote from someone in particular, she misheard you (you can always look at the card in the Alexa app to see for sure which crew member the quote is from). Please try again, and if it doesn't work, let us know! We want to continually improve our language recognition, and your feedback helps us do that!

Learn more about your favorite pop culture phenomenon...\n\nTo start the skill you can say either of the following:\n1. \"Alexa, start Star Archives\"\n2. \"Alexa, ask Star Archives\"\n\nOnce activated, you can begin asking Alexa questions like, “tell me about Luke Skywalker?” And then follow up with other questions for more details about the subject, such as, “What is is his hair color?”, “How tall is he?”, “What films has he been in?”, and so on. \n\nYou can ask Star Archives about a character’s homeworld, films, species, and attributes. You can even ask the Archives about specific starships such as, manufacturer, cost, speed, and size. \n\nYou can also ask questions about each of the seven Star Wars films. The skill will fetch a description or the “opening crawl” of that particular film.\n\nLastly, if you’re thinking about traveling to a galaxy far far away then you might want to ask the Star Archives questions about the planets you want to go to like climate, terrain, population, famous residents, and orbital period. And if you want to leave the Archives, say \"stop\", \"cancel\", or \"never mind\".\n\nThis skill is not affiliated with Star Wars, Lucasfilms, etc., and all the information in this skill was gathered from a public source and may have inconsistencies. \n\nAll of the information provided comes from the Star Wars API (https://swapi.co/) created by Paul Hallett.",

      "description": "Pros play tennis with a human umpire that coordinates flow of the match and keeps score. They get access to detailed stats to analyze and improve their game. Over years, this data provides insights into their own personal game as well as how best to compete or partner with others. \n\nWith Alexa, you can get this kind of experience at the college, club and recreational player level. Every point you play is stored so you can review statistics and trends to improve your game. \n\nTennis MatchManager coordinates both singles and doubles matches. You can sign in so that all match stats are stored for you long term, or skip sign in and just play. Even skipping sign in will allow you to review all the data about that particular match. In addition to the set and match scores, you can also hear how long you played, what percent of  games and individual points were won/lost vs that opponent, and what your win percentage was when serving.\n\nTo get started, just say 'start a match'.  If you would like to have MatchManager keep track of your match data long term, first register by saying 'register a new player'. Registered players can be added to the match by saying 'add a player'. Whether it is singles or doubles, you will have a red team and a blue team. Once you've started a match, the only  thing to do is tell Alexa who wins a point. Do that by saying 'point blue', or 'point red'. All the rest is coordinated and stored by MatchManager. \n\nOnce the match is set up, strap a Voice Remote for Amazon Echo to one of the player's arms. When they tell Alexa who wins a point, she announces it to the court and coordinates play of the match.\n\nNo wifi at the tennis club? Just use your phone as a hotspot. Need a battery for your Echo? Find them on Amazon. Stuck and need some help? More info up at www.TennisMatchManager.com.\n\nBasic things you can say to get started: \n “Start a match”\t\n“Register a new player”\nTo give a point to a player, say “point red”, or “point blue”.\n“Tell me more things I can say”\t\n\t\t\nExamples of more things you can say:\n“What's the score?”\n“Give me a summary of the match” (provides output to the Alexa app as well as verbal)\n“What's the set score?”\n“Who's serve is it?”\n“Tell me some shortcuts”\n“Tell me ways to change the match”\n\nExamples of ways that you can manually override and control the flow of the match:\n“Play with no add scoring”\n“Don't switch sides”\n“Change to blue team serve”\t\n“Change the set score”\n“Blue team won the game”\n“Start a new game”\n“Start a new set”\t\n If the score gets posted incorrectly, just say what the score should be. For example, say “30 All”\n\t\t\nExamples of combining information that will save time:\n“Start a doubles match with blue serve”\n“Add 206-867-5309 to the red team”\n“Register 425-867-5309”\n\nYou can always say “stop”, “cancel” or “exit”.",

By default the unit used will be whatever the thermostat is set to, but if you specify the unit you can temporary change it.\n\nAdditional sample phrases are:\n\n• Alexa tell the thermostat to set the temperature to 21 degrees Celsius\n• Alexa tell the thermostat to set the high temperature to 28 degrees (If you are running in heat-cool mode)\n• Alexa tell the thermostat that we are leaving\n• Alexa ask the thermostat about the humidity\n• Alexa ask the thermostat about the settings\n• Alexa ask the thermostat to keep the temperature between 72 and 80 degrees\n• Alexa tell the thermostat to change mode to heat\n• Alexa tell the thermostat to run the fan\n\nIf you are running in heat-cool mode and don't specify which temperature to set, the one that is closest to the current temperature is the one that will be changed.\n\nIf you have multiple Nests you will get to pick which Nest you wish to control through your Amazon Echo by default when you connect your skill. You can change this at any time by saying.\n\n• Alexa ask the thermostat to change device\n\nYou can also control any other thermostat in the same location by specifying its name for example.\n\n• Alexa tell the thermostat that it is a bit cold in the hallway\n• Alexa tell the thermostat to keep the temperature between 70 and 80 degrees in the den\n• Alexa tell the thermostat to change attic to heat and cool\n• Alexa tell the thermostat to run the bedroom fan\n\nIf you have multiple locations in your Nest account you will only be able to access the thermostats in the same location. You are able to also tie this skill to a Nest location that does not have a thermostat, but in that case you are only able to control the away state.\n\nTo use this skill simply enable it and log into your Nest account to link your Nest accounts with your Amazon Echo account.\n\nYou can revoke the access to your Nest from your Amazon Echo at any time by using your Nest app on your smart phone. The access will also be automatically revoked after 3 months of inactivity.\n\nNest® is a registered trademark of Nest Labs, Inc. and its parent company.",

Every player will need something to write with and on (paper, pen, phone, whiteboard, etc). When the round begins a random letter will be chosen, the following questions must be answered using a word that begins with that letter. For example if the letter is F and the question prompt is \"a car manufacturer\" you could answer Ford. \n\nAt the end of the round, review each line of every player. If two or more players have the same answer, they are offset and no points are awarded. Answers can be challenged and ruled invalid by majority vote. For example, if the prompt was \"Television Show\" and the answer was \"Band of Brothers\", majority vote may argue it was an HBO miniseries and lose that point.\n\nYou can play winners per each game or round, or have multiple rounds and add the totals of all the round, say 3 rounds. \n\nYou may play with default or custom settings. Default consists of 10 questions with 10 seconds between each question. Custom settings give you the option to choose between 1 and 20 questions and choose a difficulty; easy (15 seconds), medium (10 seconds) and hard (5 seconds).\n\nRules and instructions can be accessed by asking \"Alexa, ask Tip of Tongue for the rulebook.\"\n\nThere is currently a 161 question word bank.\n\nThere is no limit to the amount of players.",

To learn more, including why prediction markets are more accurate than polls, see electionbettingodds.com/about.html\n\nAsk Tracker for a summary to hear an overview of the current predictions for who will win each party's primary.\n\nExamples of other things you can do are: ask Tracker who is leading in the Republican or Democratic primaries, ask Tracker who will be the next president, ask Tracker about the skill itself, or, if you miss a response, ask Tracker to repeat it.\n\nCredit to Maxim Lott and John Stossel's website electionbettingodds.com for inspiration, and for the data used.\n\nAt Majel Tech, we pride ourselves on our best-in-class language recognition. We've spent a lot of time at thinking up anything you might naturally say in requesting Tracker's functionality. Go ahead, try it! We think you'll be pleased.\n\nNote: that being said, we're not perfect! Sometimes Tracker might not give you exactly what you asked for. Please try again, and if it doesn't work, let us know!

With the \"Lessons\" tool on portal.theubi.com, someone can build rules that can be mapped to different outputs: a speech utterance back through the Echo or an Alexa Voice Service enabled device; an email or text message; control of dozens of Internet connected; or an HTTP request from a web server. This can allow someone to very easily build a proof of concept around voice interaction on Echo with their service before implementing their own service with Alexa Skillsets. For example, on portal.theubi.com, someone can setup a rule that if someone says on their Echo \"jump\" the response back to the Echo will be \"How high\". Phrases spoken into the Echo can trigger multiple actions. \"Alexa, Open Portal\" or \"Alexa, ask portal (question)\" or \"Alexa, tell portal (something)\" will send the request to Ubi Cloud to check for a user created rules.

      "description": "Alexa will provide you real time UV index ratings for major cities. Check your city’s UV index here daily, and take the proper precautions to protect yourself and your family when you’re outdoors. \n\nProlonged human exposure to solar UV radiation may result in acute and chronic health effects on the skin, eye and immune system. Within just five minutes on a sunny summer day your skin may absorb enough UV radiation to develop minor sunburns. In even less time, skin cells may suffer injury that you can neither see nor feel. Multiply it over years and the damage from daily sun exposure may become major, including skin cancer and sun-induced skin aging. This skill can advise you on the strength of the sun’s UV rays in your city.\n\nThere are six UV index ratings provided: Low, Moderate, High, Very High and Extreme. To begin, simply say \"Alexa, open UV Meter\". Then you can ask \"What is the UV index in Phoenix?\" or simply say the city name. For help, simply say \"Help\" or to quit this skill, simply say \"Cancel\".",

      "description": "Say goodbye to fumbling for the light switch when you walk into the dark house with your arms full. Amazon Alexa makes it easier than ever to adjust your Wink-compatible lighting products.  You can use the Wink skill to either turn the lights on/off by saying, for example: \n\n    Alexa, turn on downstairs lamp.\n\nOr dim the lights to a desired setting: \n\n    Alexa, set living room light to 50%.\n\nNote: in order to use Amazon Alexa with Wink-compatible lighting products, you will need the Wink HUB. From there, getting started is easy:\n\n    1. Connect compatible products in your Wink app and set individual names for each lighting product (bedroom lamp, kitchen light, etc.). \n    2. Then, link your Wink account to Echo within the Echo mobile app (Settings > Connected Home > Device Links > Wink).\n    3. From there, say “Alexa, discover new devices.” This can take up to 20 seconds.\n\nYou can also adjust Wink-enabled Nest thermostats with Amazon Alexa either incrementally or to a specific temperature, making in-home climate control easier than ever. Put this Wink skill into action by saying, for example:\n\n    Alexa, increase bedroom by 3 degrees.\n\n    Alexa, set living room to 70 degrees.\n\nNote: as with lighting products, in order to use Amazon Alexa with Wink-enabled Nest Thermostats, you will need the Wink HUB. After a few simple steps, you’re ready to go:\n\n    1. If you haven’t already, first set up your Nest account and name each thermostat you have (living room, bedroom, kitchen, etc.).\n    2. Next, connect your Nest account with your Wink app. Your Nest Thermostat will appear in the Wink app as “[location] + [name] + [the word ‘thermostat’]. \"Home Living Room Thermostat,” for example.\n    3. Then, link your Wink account to Echo within the Alexa mobile app (Settings > Connected Home > Device Links > Wink). \n    4. Finally, say “Alexa, discover devices.” This can take up to 20 seconds. Your Nest Thermostat will then appear in the Alexa app as [name] i.e. “Living Room” or “Bedroom.”",

For example, you can create a Yonomi Routine called “Fall Asleep” then tell Alexa to \"Turn on Fall Asleep” and your TV shuts off via the Logitech Harmony Hub, your lights turn out, the door locks – and you're ready for bed. \n\nWith Yonomi, you can even run your Sonos via Alexa – just say \"Alexa, Turn on My Jams\" to switch your Sonos speakers to any radio station, channel, or source you like all with just your voice. Or simply say “Alexa, turn on my Living Room Sonos” to add a little atmosphere. Other devices like your TV and Fire TV can be controlled directly via your Logitech Harmony Hub. \n\nYonomi is a free software-only mobile app that plays well with over 60 of the most popular connected home devices including Logitech Harmony, Sonos, Belkin Wemo, Philips Hue, LIFX, Nest, Wink, Schlage Connect, and more.  There is no hub, router, or other hardware to buy or servers to set up.  The app is available for both iOS and Android – so download Yonomi today and start controlling all of your home devices with just a single quick voice command.\n\nVisit www.yonomi.co to get started now!",
